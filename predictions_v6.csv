"37221044","BLAB2CancerKD: a knowledge graph database focusing on the association between lactic acid bacteria and cancer, but beyond. In a broad sense, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is a general term for Gram-positive bacteria that can produce lactic acid by utilizing fermentable carbohydrates. It is widely used in essential fields such as industry, agriculture, animal husbandry and medicine. At the same time, LAB are closely related to human health. They can regulate human intestinal flora and improve gastrointestinal function and body immunity. Cancer, a disease in which some cells grow out of control and spread to other body parts, is one of the leading causes of human death worldwide. In recent years, the potential of LAB in cancer treatment has attracted attention. Mining knowledge from the scientific literature significantly accelerates its application in cancer treatment.

"38161244","Unveiling facial kinship: The BioKinVis dataset for facial kinship verification and genetic association studies. Facial image-based kinship verification represents a burgeoning frontier within the realms of computer vision and biomedicine. Recent genome-wide association studies have underscored the heritability of human facial morphology, revealing its predictability based on genetic information. These revelations form a robust foundation for advancing facial image-based kinship verification. Despite strides in computer vision, there remains a discernible gap between the biomedical and computer vision domains. Notably, the absence of family photo datasets established through biological paternity testing methods poses a significant challenge. This study addresses this gap by introducing the biological kinship visualization dataset, encompassing 5773 individuals from 2412 families with biologically confirmed kinship. Our analysis delves into the distribution and influencing factors of facial similarity among parent-child pairs, probing the potential association between forensic short tandem repeat polymorphisms and facial similarity. Additionally, we have developed a machine learning model for facial image-based kinship verification, achieving an accuracy of 0.80 in the dataset. To facilitate further exploration, we have established an online tool and database, accessible at http://120.55.161.230:88/.","12/31/2023","http://120.55.161.230:88","BioKinVis",0.754120469093323,"",0,"BioKinVis",0.7541204691,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"36412326","PlagueKD: a knowledge graph-based plague knowledge database. Plague has been confirmed as an extremely horrific international quarantine infectious disease attributed to Yersinia pestis. It has an extraordinarily high lethal rate that poses a serious hazard to human and animal lives. With the deepening of research, there has been a considerable amount of literature related to the plague that has never been systematically integrated. Indeed, it makes researchers time-consuming and laborious when they conduct some investigation. Accordingly, integrating and excavating plague-related knowledge from considerable literature takes on a critical significance. Moreover, a comprehensive plague knowledge base should be urgently built. To solve the above issues, the plague knowledge base is built for the first time. A database is built from the literature mining based on knowledge graph, which is capable of storing, retrieving, managing and accessing data. First, 5388 plague-related abstracts that were obtained automatically from PubMed are integrated, and plague entity dictionary and ontology knowledge base are constructed by using text mining technology. Second, the scattered plague-related knowledge is correlated through knowledge graph technology. A multifactor correlation knowledge graph centered on plague is formed, which contains 9633 nodes of 33 types (e.g. disease, gene, protein, species, symptom, treatment and geographic location), as well as 9466 association relations (e.g. disease-gene, gene-protein and disease-species). The Neo4j graph database is adopted to store and manage the relational data in the form of triple. Lastly, a plague knowledge base is built, which can successfully manage and visualize a large amount of structured plague-related data. This knowledge base almost provides an integrated and comprehensive plague-related knowledge. It should not only help researchers to better understand the complex pathogenesis and potential therapeutic approaches of plague but also take on a key significance to reference for exploring potential action mechanisms of corresponding drug candidates and the development of vaccine in the future. Furthermore, it is of great significance to promote the field of plague research. Researchers are enabled to acquire data more easily for more effective research.

"37329484","DSP: database of disease susceptibility genes in plants. Host-pathogen interaction is the most crucial factor that evokes the host immune system to fight against pathogens. In contrast to specialized immune cells present in humans and animals, plants have disease resistance (R-) and disease susceptibility (S-) genes. R-genes confer disease resistance and are generally introgressed from wild crop relatives to cultivated crops. S-genes, on the other hand, assist pathogens in establishing contact, displaying counter-defense measures, and spreading the infection. To achieve resistance in a variety of crops, researchers are now focusing on the identification, silencing, editing, or elimination of crucial S-genes. To aid in this field, we created the first curated database of disease susceptibility genes in plants (DSP), with the simple and advanced search tool that allows researchers to restrict the query and mining of specified hits.

"35401578","MiRAGDB: A Knowledgebase of RAG Regulators. RAG1 and RAG2 genes generate diversity in immunoglobulin and TCR genes by initiating the process of V-D-J recombination. RAGs recognize specific sequences (heptamer-nonamer) to generate a diversity of immunoglobulins. RAG expression is limited to early B and T cell developmental stages. Aberrant expression of RAG can lead to double strand breaks and translocations as observed in leukemia and lymphoma. The expression of RAG is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This study aimed to identify and catalog RAG regulation by miRNA during normal development and cancer. NGS data from normal B-cell and T-cell developmental stages and blood cancer samples have been analyzed for the expression of miRNAs against RAG1 (1,173 against human RAG1 and 749 against mouse RAG1). The analyzed data has been organized to retrieve the miRNA and mRNA expression of various RAG regulators (10 transcription factors and interacting partners) in normal and diseased states. The database allows users to navigate through the human and mouse RAG regulators, visualize and plot expression. miRAGDB is freely available and can be accessed at http://52.4.112.252/shiny/miragdb/.","3/24/2022","http://52.4.112.252/shiny/miragdb","miRAGDB",0.997167527675629,"",0,"miRAGDB",0.997167528,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Among these motifs, spherical motifs constituted 94.09%, while cylindrical motifs made up the remaining 5.91%. When considering the interaction of metal ions with aromatic residues, 965√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â564 motifs are identified. Remarkably, 82.08% of these motifs involved the binding of metal ions to the amino acid HIS. Moreover, the analysis of binding preferences between cations and aromatic residues revealed that the HIS-HIS, PHE-ARG, and TRP-ARG pairs exhibited a preferential geometry. The motif pair HIS-HIS was the most prevalent, accounting for 19.87% of the total, closely followed by TYR-LYS at 10.17%. Conversely, the motif pair TRP-HIS had the lowest occurrence, representing only 4.20% of the total. The data generated help in revealing the characteristics and biological functions of cation-aromatic interactions in biological molecules.

"35708586, 31832668","AcetoBase Version 2: a database update and re-analysis of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase amplicon sequencing data from anaerobic digesters. AcetoBase is a public repository and database of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) sequences. It is the first systematic collection of bacterial FTHFS nucleotide and protein sequences from genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes and of sequences generated by clone library sequencing. At its publication in 2019, AcetoBase (Version 1) was also the first database to establish connections between the FTHFS gene, the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Since the publication of AcetoBase, there have been significant improvements in the taxonomy of many bacterial lineages and accessibility/availability of public genomics and metagenomics data. The update to the AcetoBase reference database described here (Version 2) provides new sequence data and taxonomy, along with improvements in web functionality and user interface. The evaluation of this latest update by re-analysis of publicly accessible FTHFS amplicon sequencing data previously analysed with AcetoBase Version 1 revealed significant improvements in the taxonomic assignment of FTHFS sequences.

"35222847","ADDAGMA: A database for domestic animal gut microbiome atlas. Animal gut microbiomes play important roles in the health, diseases, and production of animal hosts. The volume of animal gut metagenomic data, including both 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing data, has been increasing exponentially in recent years, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to query, retrieve, and reanalyze experimental data and explore new hypotheses. We designed a database called the domestic animal gut microbiome atlas (ADDAGMA) to house all publicly available, high-throughput sequencing data for the gut microbiome in domestic animals. ADDAGMA enhances the availability and accessibility of the rapidly growing body of metagenomic data. We annotated microbial and metadata from four domestic animals (cattle, horse, pig, and chicken) from 356 published papers to construct a comprehensive database that is equipped with browse and search functions, enabling users to make customized, complicated, biologically relevant queries. Users can quickly and accurately obtain experimental information on sample types, conditions, and sequencing platforms, and experimental results including microbial relative abundances, microbial taxon-associated host phenotype, and P-values for gut microbes of interest. The current version of ADDAGMA includes 290,422 quantification events (changes in abundance) for 3215 microbial taxa associated with 48 phenotypes. ADDAGMA presently covers gut microbiota sequencing data from pig, cattle, horse, and chicken, but will be expanded to include other domestic animals.

"35068457","Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal: A Catalog of Genetic Findings for Alzheimer's Disease. Background Recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetics findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) span progressively larger and more diverse populations and outcomes. Currently, there is no up-to-date resource providing harmonized and searchable information on all AD genetic associations found by GWAS, nor linking the reported genetic variants and genes with functional and genomic annotations. Objective Create an integrated/harmonized, and literature-derived collection of population-specific AD genetic associations. Methods We developed the Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal (ADVP), an extensive collection of associations curated from >200 GWAS publications from Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium and other consortia. Genetic associations were systematically extracted, harmonized, and annotated from both the genome-wide significant and suggestive loci reported in these publications. To ensure consistent representation of AD genetic findings, all the extracted genetic association information was harmonized across specifically designed publication, variant, and association categories. Results ADVP V1.0 (February 2021) catalogs 6,990 associations related to disease-risk, expression quantitative traits, endophenotypes, or neuropathology. This extensive harmonization effort led to a catalog containing >900 loci, >1,800 variants, >80 cohorts, and 8 populations. Besides, ADVP provides investigators with a seamless integration of genomic and publicly available functional annotations across multiple databases per harmonized variant and gene records, thus facilitating further understanding and analyses of these genetics findings. Conclusion ADVP is a valuable resource for investigators to quickly and systematically explore high-confidence AD genetic findings and provides insights into population-specific AD genetic architecture.

"35471187","A transcriptomic atlas of Aedes aegypti reveals detailed functional organization of major body parts and gut regional specializations in sugar-fed and blood-fed adult females. Mosquitoes transmit numerous pathogens, but large gaps remain in our understanding of their physiology. To facilitate explorations of mosquito biology, we have created Aegypti-Atlas (http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com/), an online resource hosting RNAseq profiles of Ae. aegypti body parts (head, thorax, abdomen, gut, Malpighian tubules, ovaries), gut regions (crop, proventriculus, anterior and posterior midgut, hindgut), and a gut time course of blood meal digestion. Using Aegypti-Atlas, we provide insights into regionalization of gut function, blood feeding response, and immune defenses. We find that the anterior and posterior midgut possess digestive specializations which are preserved in the blood-fed state. Blood feeding initiates the sequential induction and repression/depletion of multiple cohorts of peptidases. With respect to defense, immune signaling components, but not recognition or effector molecules, show enrichment in ovaries. Basal expression of antimicrobial peptides is dominated by holotricin and gambicin, which are expressed in carcass and digestive tissues, respectively, in a mutually exclusive manner. In the midgut, gambicin and other effectors are almost exclusively expressed in the anterior regions, while the posterior midgut exhibits hallmarks of immune tolerance. Finally, in a cross-species comparison between Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae midguts, we observe that regional digestive and immune specializations are conserved, indicating that our dataset may be broadly relevant to multiple mosquito species. We demonstrate that the expression of orthologous genes is highly correlated, with the exception of a 'species signature' comprising a few highly/disparately expressed genes. With this work, we show the potential of Aegypti-Atlas to unlock a more complete understanding of mosquito biology.","4/26/2022","http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com","Aegypti-Atlas",0.987446039915085,"",0,"Aegypti-Atlas",0.98744604,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

The unusual properties of these organisms have received interest in multiple fields of biological research, and have found applications in biotechnology, especially in industrial processes. However, there are few listings of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms and their relevant environmental and physiological data. Such repositories can be used to standardize definitions of thermophile and hyperthermophile limits and tolerances and would mitigate the need for extracting organism data from diverse literature sources across multiple, sometimes loosely related, research fields. Therefore, we have developed ThermoBase, a web-based and freely available database which currently houses comprehensive descriptions for 1238 thermophilic or hyperthermophilic organisms. ThermoBase reports taxonomic, metabolic, environmental, experimental, and physiological information in addition to literature resources. This includes parameters such as coupling ions for chemiosmosis, optimal pH and range, optimal temperature and range, optimal pressure, and optimal salinity. The database interface allows for search features and sorting of parameters. As such, it is the goal of ThermoBase to facilitate and expedite hypothesis generation, literature research, and understanding relating to thermophiles and hyperthermophiles within the scientific community in an accessible and centralized repository.

"38371639","AlliumDB: a central portal for comparative and functional genomics in Allium. The genus Allium belongs to the botanical family Amaryllidaceae and includes economically important crops such as onion, garlic, bunching onion, and leek, used as vegetables, spices, and traditional medicines. The large sizes of Allium genomes hamper the genetic dissection of agronomically important traits and molecular breeding. With the growing accumulation of genomic, resequencing, transcriptome, and phenotypic data, the demand for an integrative Allium database is increasing. Here we present a user-friendly database, AlliumDB (https://allium.qau.edu.cn), as a functional genomics hub integrating public and in-house data. The database contains all currently available nuclear and organelle genomes for Allium species, with genes comprehensively annotated based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, orthology, gene families, protein families (Pfam), and non-coding RNA families (Rfam). Transcriptome and variation profiles are integrated into dynamic visualization tools. We took phenotypic photographs and generated trait records for hundreds of Allium germplasms collected worldwide, which are included in the database. We incorporated JBrowse for the visualization of gene structures, RNA sequencing data, and variation data. Analysis tools such as the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), sequence fetch, enrichment, and motif analyses are available to explore potential gene functions. This database incorporates comprehensive Allium genotypic and phenotypic datasets. As the community assembles new genomes and generates resequencing data for Allium germplasms, the database will be improved and continuously updated with these multi-omics data and comparative genomic studies. We expect the AlliumDB database to become a key resource for the study of Allium crops.","12/29/2023","http://allium.qau.edu.cn","AlliumDB",0.995748698711395,"",0,"AlliumDB",0.995748699,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"35879321","PHARP: a pig haplotype reference panel for genotype imputation. Pigs not only function as a major meat source worldwide but also are commonly used as an animal model for studying human complex traits. A large haplotype reference panel has been used to facilitate efficient phasing and imputation of relatively sparse genome-wide microarray chips and low-coverage sequencing data. Using the imputed genotypes in the downstream analysis, such as GWASs, TWASs, eQTL mapping and genomic prediction (GS), is beneficial for obtaining novel findings. However, currently, there is still a lack of publicly available and high-quality pig reference panels with large sample sizes and high diversity, which greatly limits the application of genotype imputation in pigs. In response, we built the pig Haplotype Reference Panel (PHARP) database. PHARP provides a reference panel of 2012 pig haplotypes at 34 million SNPs constructed using whole-genome sequence data from more than 49 studies of 71 pig breeds.

"37898381","The Global ALPL gene variant classification project: Dedicated to deciphering variants. Background Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inherited multisystem disorder predominantly affecting the mineralization of bones and teeth. HPP is caused by pathogenic variants in ALPL, which encodes tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) cause diagnostic delay and uncertainty amongst patients and health care providers. Results The ALPL gene variant database (https://alplmutationdatabase.jku.at/) is an open-access archive for interpretation of the clinical significance of variants reported in ALPL. The database contains coding and non-coding variants, including single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions and structural variants affecting coding or non-coding sequences of ALPL. Each variant in the database is displayed with details explaining the corresponding pathogenicity, and all reported genotypes and phenotypes, including references. In 2021, the ALPL gene variant classification project was established to reclassify VUS and continuously assess and update genetic, phenotypic, and functional variant information in the database. For this purpose, the database provides a unique submission system for clinicians, geneticists, genetic counselors, and researchers to submit VUS within ALPL for classification. An international, multidisciplinary consortium of HPP experts has been established to reclassify the submitted VUS using a multi-step process adhering to the stringent ACMG/AMP variant classification guidelines. These steps include a clinical phenotype assessment, deep literature research including artificial intelligence technology, molecular genetic assessment, and in-vitro functional testing of variants in a co-transfection model to measure ALP residual activity. Conclusion This classification project and the ALPL gene variant database will serve the global medical community, widen the genotypic and phenotypic HPP spectrum by reporting and characterizing new ALPL variants based on ACMG/AMP criteria and thus facilitate improved genetic counseling and medical decision-making for affected patients and families. The project may also serve as a gold standard framework for multidisciplinary collaboration for variant interpretation in other rare diseases.","10/26/2023","http://alplmutationdatabase.jku.at","ALPL",0.898016214370728,"",0,"ALPL",0.898016214,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","remove","","","FALSE POS: PARTIAL NAME",NA,""

AMDB also functions as a platform for the metabolomics community, providing convenient deposition and exchange of quantitative metabolomic data. To date, the majority of the data in AMDB relate to the metabolite content of the eye lens and blood of vertebrates, primarily wild species from Siberia, Russia and laboratory rodents. However, data on other tissues (muscle, heart, liver, brain, and more) are also present, and the list of species and tissues is constantly growing. Typically, every sample in AMDB contains concentrations of 60-90 of the most abundant metabolites, provided in nanomoles per gram of wet tissue weight (nmol/g). We believe that AMDB will become a widely used tool in the community, as typical metabolite baseline concentrations in tissues of animal models will aid in a wide variety of fundamental and applied scientific fields, including, but not limited to, animal modeling of human diseases, assessment of medical formulations, and evolutionary and environmental studies.","10/17/2023","http://amdb.online","AMDB",0.997219721476237,"Animal Metabolite Database",0.979104507,"AMDB",0.997219721,1,"","34747470","","","","do not merge","",NA,""

"35549894","Galbase: a comprehensive repository for integrating chicken multi-omics data. Background Multi-omics data can provide a stereoscopic view to explore potential causal variations and genes, as well as underlying genetic mechanisms of complex traits. However, for many non-mammalian species, including chickens, these resources are poorly integrated and reused, greatly limiting genetic research and breeding processes of the species. Results Here, we constructed Galbase, an easily accessible repository that integrates public chicken multi-omics data from 928 re-sequenced genomes, 429 transcriptomes, 379 epigenomes, 15,275 QTL entries, and 7,526 associations. A total of 21.67 million SNPs, 2.71 million InDels, and 488,583 cis-regulatory elements were included. Galbase allows users to retrieve genomic variations in geographical maps, gene expression profiling in heatmaps, and epigenomic signals in peak patterns. It also provides modules for batch annotation of genes, regions, and loci based on multi-layered omics data. Additionally, a series of convenient tools, including the UCSC Genome Browser, WashU Epigenome Browser, BLAT, BLAST, and LiftOver, were also integrated to facilitate search, visualization, and analysis of sequence features. Conclusion Galbase grants new opportunities to research communities to undertake in-depth functional genomic studies on chicken. All features of Galbase make it a useful resource to identify genetic variations responsible for chicken complex traits.

"36370112","The Antibody Registry: ten years of registering antibodies. Antibodies are ubiquitous key biological research resources yet are tricky to use as they are prone to performance issues and represent a major source of variability across studies. Understanding what antibody was used in a published study is therefore necessary to repeat and/or interpret a given study. However, antibody reagents are still frequently not cited with sufficient detail to determine which antibody was used in experiments. The Antibody Registry is a public, open database that enables citation of antibodies by providing a persistent record for any antibody-based reagent used in a publication. The registry is the authority for antibody Research Resource Identifiers, or RRIDs, which are requested or required by hundreds of journals seeking to improve the citation of these key resources. The registry is the most comprehensive listing of persistently identified antibody reagents used in the scientific literature. Data contributors span individual authors who use antibodies to antibody companies, which provide their entire catalogs including discontinued items. Unlike many commercial antibody listing sites which tend to remove reagents no longer sold, registry records persist, providing an interface between a fast-moving commercial marketplace and the static scientific literature.

"37695921","The antimicrobial peptide database is 20 years old: Recent developments and future directions. In 2023, the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (currently available at https://aps.unmc.edu) is 20-years-old. The timeline for the APD expansion in peptide entries, classification methods, search functions, post-translational modifications, binding targets, and mechanisms of action of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been summarized in our previous Protein Science paper. This article highlights new database additions and findings. To facilitate antimicrobial development to combat drug-resistant pathogens, the APD has been re-annotating the data for antibacterial activity (active, inactive, and uncertain), toxicity (hemolytic and nonhemolytic AMPs), and salt tolerance (salt sensitive and insensitive). Comparison of the respective desired and undesired AMP groups produces new knowledge for peptide design. Our unification of AMPs from the six life kingdoms into ""natural AMPs"" enabled the first comparison with globular or transmembrane proteins. Due to the dominance of amphipathic helical and disulfide-linked peptides, cysteine, glycine, and lysine in natural AMPs are much more abundant than those in globular proteins. To include peptides predicted by machine learning, a new ""predicted"" group has been created. Remarkably, the averaged amino acid composition of predicted peptides is located between the lower bound of natural AMPs and the upper bound of synthetic peptides. Synthetic peptides in the current APD, with the highest cationic and hydrophobic amino acid percentages, are mostly designed with varying degrees of optimization. Hence, natural AMPs accumulated in the APD over 20√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬âyears have laid the foundation for machine learning prediction.

"37216609","Human AGEs: an interactive spatio-temporal visualization and database of human archeogenomics. Archeogenomics is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary research field driven by the development of techniques that enable the acquisition and analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA). Recent advances in aDNA studies have contributed significantly to increasing our understanding of the natural history of humans. One of the most significant challenges facing archeogenomics is the integration of highly heterogeneous genomic, archeological, and anthropological data and their comprehensive analysis, considering changes that occur in time and space. Only this complex approach can explain the relationship between past populations in the context of migration or cultural development. To address these challenges, we developed a Human AGEs web server. It focuses on creating comprehensive spatiotemporal visualizations of genomic, archeogenomic, and archeological information, which can be provided by the user or loaded from a graph database. The interactive map application at the center of Human AGEs can display multiple layers of data in various forms, such as bubble charts, pie charts, heatmaps, or tag clouds. These visualizations can be modified using various clustering, filtering, and styling options, and the map state can be exported to a high-resolution image or saved as a session file for later use.

"34718689","ARTS-DB: a database for antibiotic resistant targets. As a result of the continuous evolution of drug resistant bacteria, new antibiotics are urgently needed. Encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), antibiotic compounds are mostly produced by bacteria. With the exponential increase in the number of publicly available, sequenced genomes and the advancements of BGC prediction tools, genome mining algorithms have uncovered millions of uncharacterized BGCs for further evaluation. Since compound identification and characterization remain bottlenecks, a major challenge is prioritizing promising BGCs. Recently, researchers adopted self-resistance based strategies allowing them to predict the biological activities of natural products encoded by uncharacterized BGCs. Since 2017, the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS) facilitated this so-called target-directed genome mining (TDGM) approach for the prioritization of BGCs encoding potentially novel antibiotics. Here, we present the ARTS database, available at https://arts-db.ziemertlab.com/. The ARTS database provides pre-computed ARTS results for >70,000 genomes and metagenome assembled genomes in total. Advanced search queries allow users to rapidly explore the fundamental criteria of TDGM such as BGC proximity, duplication and horizontal gene transfers of essential housekeeping genes. Furthermore, the ARTS database provides results interconnected throughout the bacterial kingdom as well as links to known databases in natural product research.","1/1/2022","http://arts-db.ziemertlab.com","ARTS",0.60979425907135,"Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker",0.790353626012802,"Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker",0.790353626,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

The aggregation of a presynaptic protein, √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬é√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬±-synuclein (aSyn), is the primary neurological hallmark of PD and, thus, a promising target for therapeutic intervention. However, the lack of consensus on the molecular properties required to specifically bind the toxic species formed during aSyn aggregation has hindered the development of therapeutic molecules. Recently, we defined and experimentally validated a peptide architecture that demonstrated high affinity and selectivity in binding to aSyn toxic oligomers and fibrils, effectively preventing aSyn pathogenic aggregation. Human peptides with such properties may have neuroprotective activities and hold a huge therapeutic interest. Driven by this idea, here, we developed a discriminative algorithm for the screening of human endogenous neuropeptides, antimicrobial peptides and diet-derived bioactive peptides with the potential to inhibit aSyn aggregation. We identified over 100 unique biogenic peptide candidates and ensembled a comprehensive database (aSynPEP-DB) that collects their physicochemical features, source datasets and additional therapeutic-relevant information, including their sites of expression and associated pathways. Besides, we provide access to the discriminative algorithm to extend its application to the screening of artificial peptides or new peptide datasets. aSynPEP-DB is a unique repository of peptides with the potential to modulate aSyn aggregation, serving as a platform for the identification of previously unexplored therapeutic agents.

ATTED-II (https://atted.jp) is a gene coexpression database for nine plant species based on publicly available RNAseq and microarray data. One of the challenges in constructing condition-independent coexpression data based on publicly available gene expression data is managing the inherent sampling bias. Here, we report ATTED-II version 11, wherein we adopted a coexpression calculation methodology to balance the samples using principal component analysis and ensemble calculation. This approach has two advantages. First, omitting principal components with low contribution rates reduces the main contributors of noise. Second, balancing large differences in contribution rates enables considering various sample conditions entirely. In addition, based on RNAseq- and microarray-based coexpression data, we provide species-representative, integrated coexpression information to enhance the efficiency of interspecies comparison of the coexpression data. These coexpression data are provided as a standardized z-score to facilitate integrated analysis with different data sources. We believe that with these improvements, ATTED-II is more valuable and powerful for supporting interspecies comparative studies and integrated analyses using heterogeneous data.","6/1/2022","http://atted.jp","ATTED-II",0.954756707,"",0,"ATTED-II",0.954756707,2,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"37589496","AutophagyNet: high-resolution data source for the analysis of autophagy and its regulation. Macroautophagy/autophagy is a highly-conserved catabolic procss eliminating dysfunctional cellular components and invading pathogens. Autophagy malfunction contributes to disorders such as cancer, neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. Understanding autophagy regulation in health and disease has been the focus of the last decades. We previously provided an integrated database for autophagy research, the Autophagy Regulatory Network (ARN). For the last eight years, this resource has been used by thousands of users. Here, we present a new and upgraded resource, AutophagyNet. It builds on the previous database but contains major improvements to address user feedback and novel needs due to the advancement in omics data availability. AutophagyNet contains updated interaction curation and integration of over 280,000 experimentally verified interactions between core autophagy proteins and their protein, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators as well as their potential upstream pathway connections. AutophagyNet provides annotations for each core protein about their role: 1) in different types of autophagy (mitophagy, xenophagy, etc.); 2) in distinct stages of autophagy (initiation, expansion, termination, etc.); 3) with subcellular and tissue-specific localization. These annotations can be used to filter the dataset, providing customizable download options tailored to the user's needs. The resource is available in various file formats (e.g. CSV, BioPAX and PSI-MI), and data can be analyzed and visualized directly in Cytoscape. The multi-layered regulation of autophagy can be analyzed by combining AutophagyNet with tissue- or cell type-specific (multi-)omics datasets (e.g. transcriptomic or proteomic data).

"34850139","CircNet 2.0: an updated database for exploring circular RNA regulatory networks in cancers. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are single-stranded RNA molecules that have individually formed into a covalently closed continuous loop, act as sponges of microRNAs to regulate transcription and translation. CircRNAs are important molecules in the field of cancer diagnosis, as growing evidence suggests that they are closely related to pathological cancer features. Therefore, they have high potential for clinical use as novel cancer biomarkers. In this article, we present our updates to CircNet (version 2.0), into which circRNAs from circAtlas and MiOncoCirc, and novel circRNAs from The Cancer Genome Atlas database have been integrated. In total, 2732 samples from 37 types of cancers were integrated into CircNet 2.0 and analyzed using several of the most reliable circRNA detection algorithms.

"34850155","dbAMP 2.0: updated resource for antimicrobial peptides with an enhanced scanning method for genomic and proteomic data. The last 18 months, or more, have seen a profound shift in our global experience, with many of us navigating a once-in-100-year pandemic. To date, COVID-19 remains a life-threatening pandemic with little to no targeted therapeutic recourse. The discovery of novel antiviral agents, such as vaccines and drugs, can provide therapeutic solutions to save human beings from severe infections; however, there is no specifically effective antiviral treatment confirmed for now. Thus, great attention has been paid to the use of natural or artificial antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as these compounds are widely regarded as promising solutions for the treatment of harmful microorganisms. Given the biological significance of AMPs, it was obvious that there was a significant need for a single platform for identifying and engaging with AMP data. This led to the creation of the dbAMP platform that provides comprehensive information about AMPs and facilitates their investigation and analysis.

"34788852","dbPTM in 2022: an updated database for exploring regulatory networks and functional associations of protein post-translational modifications. Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play an important role in different cellular processes. In view of the importance of PTMs in cellular functions and the massive data accumulated by the rapid development of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, this paper presents an update of dbPTM with over 2 777 000 PTM substrate sites obtained from existing databases and manual curation of literature, of which more than 2 235 000 entries are experimentally verified. This update has manually curated over 42 new modification types that were not included in the previous version. Due to the increasing number of studies on the mechanism of PTMs in the past few years, a great deal of upstream regulatory proteins of PTM substrate sites have been revealed. The updated dbPTM thus collates regulatory information from databases and literature, and merges them into a protein-protein interaction network. To enhance the understanding of the association between PTMs and molecular functions/cellular processes, the functional annotations of PTMs are curated and integrated into the database. In addition, the existing PTM-related resources, including annotation databases and prediction tools are also renewed. Overall, in this update, we would like to provide users with the most abundant data and comprehensive annotations on PTMs of proteins.

"36329825, 34976872","'Targeting' the search: An upgraded structural and functional repository of antimicrobial peptides for biofilm studies (B-AMP v2.0) with a focus on biofilm protein targets. Bacterial biofilms, often as multispecies communities, are recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics, making the treatment of biofilm infections a challenge. There is a push towards developing novel anti-biofilm approaches, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), with activity against specific biofilm targets. In previous work, we developed Biofilm-AMP, a structural and functional repository of AMPs for biofilm studies (B-AMP v1.0) with more than 5000 structural models of AMPs and a vast library of AMP annotations to existing biofilm literature. In this study, we present an upgraded version of B-AMP, with a focus on existing and novel bacterial biofilm targets. B-AMP v2.0 hosts a curated collection of 2502 biofilm protein targets across 473 bacterial species, with structural protein models and functional annotations from PDB, UniProt, and PubMed databases. The biofilm targets can be searched for using the name of the source organism, and function and type of protein, and results include designated Target IDs (unique to B-AMP v2.0), UniProt IDs, 3D predicted protein structures, PDBQT files, pre-defined protein functions, and relevant scientific literature. To present an example of the combined applicability of both, the AMP and biofilm target libraries in the repository, we present two case studies. In the first case study, we expand an in silico pipeline to evaluate AMPs against a single biofilm target in the multidrug resistant, bacterial pathogen Corynebacterium striatum, using 3D protein-peptide docking models from previous work and Molecular Dynamics simulations (~1.2√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬µs).

Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), belonging to the Bovidae family, is an economically important animal as it is the major source of milk, meat, and drought in numerous countries. It is mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions with a global population of approximately 202 million. The advent of low cost and rapid sequencing technologies has opened a new vista for global buffalo researchers. In this study, we utilized the genomic data of five commercially important buffalo breeds, distributed globally, namely, Mediterranean, Egyptian, Bangladesh, Jaffrarabadi, and Murrah. Since there is no whole-genome sequence analysis of these five distinct buffalo breeds, which represent a highly diverse ecosystem, we made an attempt for the same. We report the first comprehensive, holistic, and user-friendly web genomic resource of buffalo (BuffGR) accessible at http://backlin.cabgrid.res.in/buffgr/, that catalogues 6028881 SNPs and 613403 InDels extracted from a set of 31 buffalo tissues.

"36131236","BGFD: an integrated multi-omics database of barley gene families. Background A gene family comprises a group of genes with similar functional domains that play various roles in plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is the fourth most cultivated cereal crop worldwide, and it is an important model species for genetic studies. Systematic identification and annotation of gene families are key for studies of molecular function and evolutionary history. Results We constructed a multi-omics database containing 5593 genes of 77 gene families called the Barley Gene Family Database (BGFD: http://barleygfdb.com ). BGFD is a free, user-friendly, and web-accessible platform that provides data on barley family genes. BGFD provides intuitive visual displays to facilitate studies of the physicochemical properties, gene structure, phylogenetic relationships, and motif organization of genes. Massive multi-omics datasets have been acquired and processed to generate an atlas of expression pattern profiles and genetic variation in BGFD. The platform offers several practical toolkits to conduct searches, browse, and employ BLAST functions, and the data are downloadable. Conclusions BGFD will aid research on the domestication and adaptive evolution of barley; it will also facilitate the screening of candidate genes and exploration of important agronomic traits in barley.","9/21/2022","http://barleygfdb.com","BGFD",0.994630098342896,"Barley Gene Family Database",0.951987648010254,"BGFD",0.994630098,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37389760","A comprehensive analysis of the Bencao (herbal) small RNA Atlas reveals novel RNA therapeutics for treating human diseases. Cross-kingdom herbal miRNA was first reported in 2012. Using a modified herbal extraction protocol, we obtained 73,677,287 sequences by RNA-seq from 245 traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), of which 20,758,257 were unique sequences. We constructed a Bencao (herbal) small RNA (sRNA) Atlas ( http://bencao.bmicc.cn ), annotated the sequences by sequence-based clustering, and created a nomenclature system for Bencao sRNAs. The profiles of 21,757 miRNAs in the Atlas were highly consistent with those of plant miRNAs in miRBase. Using software tools, our results demonstrated that all human genes might be regulated by sRNAs from the Bencao sRNA Atlas, part of the predicted human target genes were experimentally validated, suggesting that Bencao sRNAs might be one of the main bioactive components of herbal medicines. We established roadmaps for oligonucleotide drugs development and optimization of TCM prescriptions. Moreover, the decoctosome, a lipo-nano particle consisting of 0.5%-2.5% of the decoction, demonstrated potent medical effects. We propose a Bencao (herbal) Index, including small-molecule compounds (SM), protein peptides (P), nucleic acid (N), non-nucleic and non-proteinogenic large-molecule compounds (LM) and elements from Mendeleev's periodic table (E), to quantitatively measure the medical effects of botanic medicine. The Bencao sRNA Atlas is a resource for developing gene-targeting oligonucleotide drugs and optimizing botanical medicine, and may provide potential remedies for the theory and practice of one medicine.","6/26/2023","http://bencao.bmicc.cn","Bencao",0.654891908168793,"",0,"Bencao",0.654891908,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","remove","","","FALSE POS: PARTIAL NAME",NA,""

"36263784","BIC: a database for the transcriptional landscape of bacteria in cancer. Microbial communities are massively resident in the human body, yet dysbiosis has been reported to correlate with many diseases, including various cancers. Most studies focus on the gut microbiome, while the bacteria that participate in tumor microenvironments on site remain unclear. Previous studies have acquired the bacteria expression profiles from RNA-seq, whole genome sequencing, and whole exon sequencing in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, small-RNA sequencing data were rarely used. Using TCGA miRNA sequencing data, we evaluated bacterial abundance in 32 types of cancer. To uncover the bacteria involved in cancer, we applied an analytical process to align unmapped human reads to bacterial references and developed the BIC database for the transcriptional landscape of bacteria in cancer. BIC provides cancer-associated bacterial information, including the relative abundance of bacteria, bacterial diversity, associations with clinical relevance, the co-expression network of bacteria and human genes, and their associated biological functions. These results can complement previously published databases. Users can easily download the result plots and tables, or download the bacterial abundance matrix for further analyses. In summary, BIC can provide information on cancer microenvironments related to microbial communities.

"36624664","NPASS database update 2023: quantitative natural product activity and species source database for biomedical research. Quantitative activity and species source data of natural products (NPs) are important for drug discovery, medicinal plant research, and microbial investigations. Activity values of NPs against specific targets are useful for discovering targeted therapeutic agents and investigating the mechanism of medicinal plants.

"37833498, 37528331, 36406421","Exploring outer space biophysical phenomena via SpaceLID. Extensive investigations in outer space have revealed not only how life adapts to the space environment, but also that interesting biophysical phenomena occur. These phenomena affect human health and other life forms (animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi), and to ensure the safety of future human space exploration need to be further investigated. This calls for joint research efforts between biologists and physicists, as these phenomena present cross-disciplinary barriers. Various national organizations provide useful forums for bridging this gap. Additional discussion avenues and database resources are helpful for facilitating the interdisciplinary investigations of these phenomena. In this paper, we present the newly established Space Life Investigation Database (SpaceLID, https://bidd.group/spacelid/ ) which provides information about biophysical phenomena occurring in space. Examples obtained using the database are given while discussing the underlying causes of these phenomena and their implications for the physiology and health of life in space.","10/13/2023","http://bidd.group/spacelid","SpaceLID",0.988763779401779,"Space Life Investigation Database",0.94957871735096,"SpaceLID",0.988763779,3,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37059238","The BIGG-REC database makes available all WHO/PAHO evidence informed recommendations. Objectives To build and maintain a living database of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) recommendations developed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Study design and setting Guidelines are identified from WHO and PAHO databases. We periodically extract recommendations, according to the health and well-being targets of sustainable development goal 3 (SDG-3). Results As of March 2022, the International database of GRADE guidelines (https://bigg-rec.bvsalud.org/en) database hosted 2,682 recommendations contained in 285 WHO/PAHO guidelines. Recommendations were classified as follows: communicable diseases (1,581), children's health (1,182), universal health (1,171), sexual and reproductive health (910), noncommunicable diseases (677), maternal health (654), COVID-19 (224), use of psychoactive substances (99), tobacco (14) and road and traffic accidents (16). International database of GRADE guidelines allows searching by SDG-3, condition or disease, type of intervention, institution, year of publication, and age. Conclusion Recommendation maps provide an important resource for health professionals, organizations and member states that use evidence-informed guidance to make better decisions, providing a source for the adoption or adaptation of recommendations to meet their needs. This one-stop shop database of evidence-informed recommendations built with intuitive functionalities undoubtedly represents a long-needed tool for decision-makers, guideline developers, and the public at large.","4/12/2023","http://bigg-rec.bvsalud.org/en","BIGG-REC",0.674220055341721,"of",0.687605619,"of",0.6876056194,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","remove","","","FALSE POS: INCORRECT NAME",NA,""

"36215029, 31584099","gutMDisorder v2.0: a comprehensive database for dysbiosis of gut microbiota in phenotypes and interventions. Gut microbiota plays a significant role in maintaining host health, and conversely, disorders potentially lead to dysbiosis, an imbalance in the composition of the gut microbial community. Intervention approaches, such as medications, diets, and several others, also alter the gut microbiota in either a beneficial or harmful direction. In 2020, the gutMDisorder was developed to facilitate researchers in the investigation of dysbiosis of gut microbes as occurs in various disorders as well as with therapeutic interventions.

Various microbes have been found to colonize cancer tissues and play important roles in cancer diagnoses and outcomes, with many studies focusing on developing better cancer-related microbiome data. However, there are currently no independent, comprehensive open resources cataloguing cancer-related microbiome data, which limits the exploration of the relationship between these microbes and cancer progression. Given this, we propose a new strategy to re-align the existing next-generation sequencing data to facilitate the mining of hidden sequence data describing the microbiome to maximize available resources. To this end, we collected 417 publicly available datasets from 25 human and 14 mouse tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and use these to develop a novel pipeline to re-align microbiome sequences facilitating in-depth analyses designed to reveal the microbial profile of various cancer tissues and their healthy controls. microbioTA is a user-friendly online platform which allows users to browse, search, visualize, and download microbial abundance data from various tissues along with corresponding analysis results, aimimg at providing a reference for cancer-related microbiome research.","1/1/2023","http://bio-annotation.cn/microbiota","microbioTA",0.997455775737762,"",0,"microbioTA",0.997455776,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Summary Emerging evidences have suggested that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins plays a vital role both in a wide range of biological processes and in related diseases. Whether a protein undergoes phase separation not only is determined by the chemical and physical properties of biomolecule themselves, but also is regulated by environmental conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, pH, as well as volume excluded by other macromolecules. A web accessible database LLPSDB was developed recently by our group, in which all the proteins involved in LLPS in vitro as well as corresponding experimental conditions were curated comprehensively from published literatures. With the rapid increase of investigations in biomolecular LLPS and growing popularity of LLPSDB, we updated the database, and developed a new version LLPSDB v2.0. In comparison of the previously released version, more than double contents of data are curated, and a new class 'Ambiguous system' is added. In addition, the web interface is improved, such as that users can search the database by selecting option 'phase separation status' alone or combined with other options. We anticipate that this updated database will serve as a more comprehensive and helpful resource for users.

"37743473","CrMP-Sol database: classification, bioinformatic analyses and comparison of cancer-related membrane proteins and their water-soluble variant designs. Membrane proteins are critical mediators for tumor progression and present enormous therapeutic potentials. Although gene profiling can identify their cancer-specific signatures, systematic correlations between protein functions and tumor-related mechanisms are still unclear. We present here the CrMP-Sol database ( https://bio-gateway.aigene.org.cn/g/CrMP ), which aims to breach the gap between the two. Machine learning was used to extract key functional descriptions for protein visualization in the 3D-space, where spatial distributions provide function-based predictive connections between proteins and cancer types. CrMP-Sol also presents QTY-enabled water-soluble designs to facilitate native membrane protein studies despite natural hydrophobicity. Five examples with varying transmembrane helices in different categories were used to demonstrate the feasibility. Native and redesigned proteins exhibited highly similar characteristics, predicted structures and binding pockets, and slightly different docking poses against known ligands, although task-specific designs are still required for proteins more susceptible to internal hydrogen bond formations. The database can accelerate therapeutic developments and biotechnological applications of cancer-related membrane proteins.","9/25/2023","http://bio-gateway.aigene.org.cn/g/CrMP","CrMP-Sol",0.993337690830231,"",0,"CrMP-Sol",0.993337691,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Aging and cellular senescence are characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, which could be triggered by aging factors such as physiological, pathological and external factors. Numerous studies have shown that gene regulatory events play crucial roles in aging, increasing the need for a comprehensive repository of regulatory relationships during aging. Here, we established a manually curated database of aging factors (AgingReG, https://bio.liclab.net/Aging-ReG/), focusing on the regulatory relationships during aging with experimental evidence in humans. By curating thousands of published literature, 2157 aging factor entries (1345 aging gene entries, 804 external factor entries and eight aging-related pathway entries) and related regulatory information were manually curated. The regulatory relationships were classified into four types according to their functions: (i) upregulation, which indicates that aging factors upregulate the expression of target genes during aging; (ii) downregulation, which indicates that aging factors downregulate the expression of target genes during aging; (iii) activation, which indicates that aging factors influence the activity of target genes during aging and (iv) inhibition, which indicates that aging factors inhibit the activation of target molecule activity, leading to declined or lost target activity. AgingReG involves 651 upregulating pairs, 632 downregulating pairs, 330 activation-regulating pairs and 34 inhibition-regulating pairs, covering 195 disease types and more than 800 kinds of cells and tissues from 1784 published literature studies. AgingReG provides a user-friendly interface to query, browse and visualize detailed information about the regulatory relationships during aging. We believe that AgingReG will serve as a valuable resource database in the field of aging research.

"35186035","TRmir: A Comprehensive Resource for Human Transcriptional Regulatory Information of MiRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which play important roles in regulating various biological functions. Many available miRNA databases have provided a large number of valuable resources for miRNA investigation. However, not all existing databases provide comprehensive information regarding the transcriptional regulatory regions of miRNAs, especially typical enhancer, super-enhancer (SE), and chromatin accessibility regions. An increasing number of studies have shown that the transcriptional regulatory regions of miRNAs, as well as related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and transcription factors (TFs) have a strong influence on human diseases and biological processes. Here, we developed a comprehensive database for the human transcriptional regulation of miRNAs (TRmir), which is focused on providing a wealth of available resources regarding the transcriptional regulatory regions of miRNAs and annotating their potential roles in the regulation of miRNAs. TRmir contained a total of 5,754,414 typical enhancers/SEs and 1,733,966 chromatin accessibility regions associated with 1,684 human miRNAs. These regions were identified from over 900 human H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and DNase-seq samples. Furthermore, TRmir provided detailed (epi)genetic information about the transcriptional regulatory regions of miRNAs, including TFs, common SNPs, risk SNPs, linkage disequilibrium (LD) SNPs, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), 3D chromatin interactions, and methylation sites, especially supporting the display of TF binding sites in the regulatory regions of over 7,000 TF ChIP-seq samples. In addition, TRmir integrated miRNA expression and related disease information, supporting extensive pathway analysis.

"35445695","A3D database: structure-based predictions of protein aggregation for the human proteome. Summary Protein aggregation is associated with many human disorders and constitutes a major bottleneck for producing therapeutic proteins. Our knowledge of the human protein structures repertoire has dramatically increased with the recent development of the AlphaFold (AF) deep-learning method. This structural information can be used to understand better protein aggregation properties and the rational design of protein solubility. This article uses the Aggrescan3D (A3D) tool to compute the structure-based aggregation predictions for the human proteome and make the predictions available in a database form. In the A3D database, we analyze the AF-predicted human protein structures (for over 20.5 thousand unique Uniprot IDs) in terms of their aggregation properties using the A3D tool. Each entry of the A3D database provides a detailed analysis of the structure-based aggregation propensity computed with A3D. The A3D database implements simple but useful graphical tools for visualizing and interpreting protein structure datasets. It also enables testing the influence of user-selected mutations on protein solubility and stability, all integrated into a user-friendly interface.

"37716955","A3DyDB: exploring structural aggregation propensities in the yeast proteome. Background The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is a well-established model system for studying protein aggregation due to the conservation of essential cellular structures and pathways found across eukaryotes. However, limited structural knowledge of its proteome has prevented a deeper understanding of yeast functionalities, interactions, and aggregation. Results In this study, we introduce the A3D yeast database (A3DyDB), which offers an extensive catalog of aggregation propensity predictions for the S. cerevisiae proteome. We used Aggrescan 3D (A3D) and the newly released protein models from AlphaFold2 (AF2) to compute the structure-based aggregation predictions for 6039 yeast proteins. The A3D algorithm exploits the information from 3D protein structures to calculate their intrinsic aggregation propensities. To facilitate simple and intuitive data analysis, A3DyDB provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing, and visualizing information on aggregation predictions from yeast protein structures. The A3DyDB also allows for the evaluation of the influence of natural or engineered mutations on protein stability and solubility. The A3DyDB is freely available at http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/A3D2/yeast . Conclusion The A3DyDB addresses a gap in yeast resources by facilitating the exploration of correlations between structural aggregation propensity and diverse protein properties at the proteome level.

"36346548","SecReT6 update: a comprehensive resource of bacterial Type VI Secretion Systems. Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) plays significant roles in microbial activities via injecting effectors into adjacent cells or environments. T6SS increasingly gained attention due to its important influence on pathogenesis, microbial competition, etc. T6SS-associated research is explosively expanding on numerous grounds that call for an efficient resource. The SecReT6 version 3 provides comprehensive information on T6SS and the interactions between T6SS and T6SS-related proteins such as T6SS regulators and T6SS effectors. To assist T6SS researches like microbial competition and regulatory mechanisms, SecReT6 v3 developed online tools for detection and analysis of T6SS and T6SS-related proteins and estimation of T6SS-dependent killing risk. We have identified a novel T6SS regulator and T6SS-dependent killing capacity in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates with the aid of SecReT6 v3. 17,212 T6SSs and plentiful T6SS-related proteins in 26,573 bacterial complete genomes were also detected, analyzed and incorporated into the database.

Epitranscriptomic changes caused by adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancers; however, only a small fraction of the millions editing sites detected so far has clear functionality. To facilitate more in-depth studies on the editing, this paper offers REIA (http://bioinfo-sysu.com/reia), an interactive web server that analyses and visualizes the association between human cancers and A-to-I RNA editing sites (RESs). As a comprehensive database, REIA curates not only 8,447,588 RESs from 9,895 patients across 34 cancers, where 33 are from TCGA and 1 from GEO, but also 13 different types of multi-omic data for the cancers. As an interactive server, REIA provides various options for the user to specify the interested sites, to browse their annotation/editing level/profile in cancer, and to compare the difference in multi-omic features between editing and non-editing groups.

Evaluating the prognostic value of genes of interest in different populations of gastric cancer (GC) is difficult and time-consuming for basic and translational researchers even though many datasets are available in public dataset depositories. In the current study, we developed a robust web-based portal called OSgc (Online consensus Survival analysis of gastric cancer) that enables easy and swift verification of known and novel biomarker candidates in GC. OSgc is composed of gene expression profiling data and clinical follow-up information of 1,824 clinical GC cases, which are collected from 7 public independent datasets derived from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). By OSgc, users input the official gene symbol and will promptly retrieve the Kaplan-Meier survival plot with hazard ratio (HR) and log rank p value on the output webpage, by which users could assess the prognostic value of interesting genes for GC patients. Five survival end points containing overall survival, progression-free survival, progression-free interval, relapse-free survival, and disease-free survival could be measured in OSgc. OSgc can greatly help cancer biologists and clinicians to explore the effect of gene expression on patient survival.

"36913438","dbAQP-SNP: a database of missense single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human aquaporins. Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins belong to the superfamily of major intrinsic proteins (MIPs), and they transport water and other neutral solutes such as glycerol. These channel proteins are involved in vital physiological processes and are implicated in several human diseases. Experimentally determined structures of MIPs from diverse organisms reveal a unique hour-glass fold with six transmembrane helices and two half-helices. MIP channels have two constrictions formed by Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs and aromatic/arginine selectivity filters (Ar/R SFs). Several reports have found associations among single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human aquaporins (AQPs) with diseases in specific populations. In this study, we have compiled 2798 SNPs that give rise to missense mutations in 13 human AQPs. To understand the nature of missense substitutions, we have systematically analyzed the pattern of substitutions. We found several examples in which substitutions could be considered as non-conservative that include small to big or hydrophobic to charged residues. We also analyzed these substitutions in the context of structure. We have identified SNPs that occur in NPA motifs or Ar/R SFs, and they will most certainly disrupt the structure and/or transport properties of human AQPs. We found 22 examples in which missense SNP substitutions that are mostly non-conservative in nature have given rise to pathogenic conditions as found in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. It is most likely that not all missense SNPs in human AQPs will result in diseases. However, understanding the effect of missense SNPs on the structure and function of human AQPs is important. In this direction, we have developed a database dbAQP-SNP that contains information about all 2798 SNPs. This database has several features and search options that can help the user to find SNPs in specific positions of human AQPs including the functionally and/or structurally important regions. dbAQP-SNP (http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/dbAQP-SNP) is freely available to the academic community.

"36159991","AntiVIRmiR: A repository of host antiviral miRNAs and their expression along with experimentally validated viral miRNAs and their targets. miRNAs play an essential role in promoting viral infections as well as modulating the antiviral defense. Several miRNA repositories have been developed for different species, e.g., human, mouse, and plant. However, 'VIRmiRNA' is the only existing resource for experimentally validated viral miRNAs and their targets. We have developed a 'AntiVIRmiR' resource encompassing data on host/virus miRNA expression during viral infection. This resource with 22,741 entries is divided into four sub-databases viz., 'DEmiRVIR', 'AntiVmiR', 'VIRmiRNA2' and 'VIRmiRTar2'. 'DEmiRVIR' has 10,033 differentially expressed host-viral miRNAs for 21 viruses. 'AntiVmiR' incorporates 1,642 entries for host miRNAs showing antiviral activity for 34 viruses. Additionally, 'VIRmiRNA2' includes 3,340 entries for experimentally validated viral miRNAs from 50 viruses along with 650 viral isomeric sequences for 14 viruses. Further, 'VIRmiRTar2' has 7,726 experimentally validated targets for viral miRNAs against 21 viruses. Furthermore, we have also performed network analysis for three sub-databases. Interactions between up/down-regulated human miRNAs and viruses are displayed for 'AntiVmiR' as well as 'DEmiRVIR'. Moreover, 'VIRmiRTar2' interactions are shown among different viruses, miRNAs, and their targets. We have provided browse, search, external hyperlinks, data statistics, and useful analysis tools.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which play critical roles in gene regulatory networks, have emerged as promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for human cancer. In particular, circulating miRNAs that are secreted into circulation exist in remarkably stable forms, and have enormous potential to be leveraged as non-invasive biomarkers for early cancer detection. Novel and user-friendly tools are desperately needed to facilitate data mining of the vast amount of miRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and large-scale circulating miRNA profiling studies. To fill this void, we developed CancerMIRNome, a comprehensive database for the interactive analysis and visualization of miRNA expression profiles based on 10 554 samples from 33 TCGA projects and 28 633 samples from 40 public circulating miRNome datasets. A series of cutting-edge bioinformatics tools and machine learning algorithms have been packaged in CancerMIRNome, allowing for the pan-cancer analysis of a miRNA of interest across multiple cancer types and the comprehensive analysis of miRNome profiles to identify dysregulated miRNAs and develop diagnostic or prognostic signatures. The data analysis and visualization modules will greatly facilitate the exploit of the valuable resources and promote translational application of miRNA biomarkers in cancer.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy provides remarkable clinical benefits for multiple cancer types. Much work is currently being conducted to investigate the mechanisms of ICB therapy at the transcriptional level. Integrating the data produced by these studies will help us give more insight into the transcriptomic features of ICB therapy. We collected the transcriptome and clinical data of ICB-treated patient samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus, ArrayExpress, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and dbGaP databases. On the basis of the clinical information, all samples are initially classified into response/nonresponse or pretreatment/on-treatment groups. Differential expression, pathway enrichment, and immune cell infiltration analyses are performed between the samples from different groups. We also introduce the Response Score (RS) calculated by integrating the variability degree and the frequency of the dysregulated genes in the responders to evaluate the impact of gene expression on the response. Finally, all the abovementioned contents are integrated into the ICBatlas database. ICBatlas provides the transcriptome features of ICB therapy through the analysis of 1,515 ICB-treated samples from 25 studies across nine cancer types.

Here, we developed ipaQTL-atlas (http://bioinfo.szbl.ac.cn/ipaQTL) as the first comprehensive portal for intronic polyadenylation. The ipaQTL-atlas is based on the analysis of 15 170 RNA-seq data from 838 individuals across 49 Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v8) tissues and contains √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬à√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬º0.98 million SNPs associated with intronic APA events.

The study of molecular interactions, especially the inter-species protein-protein interactions, is crucial for understanding the disease infection mechanism in plants. These interactions play an important role in disease infection and host immune responses against pathogen attack. Among various critical fungal diseases, the incidences of Karnal bunt (Tilletia indica) around the world have hindered the export of the crops such as wheat from infected regions, thus causing substantial economic losses. Due to sparse information on T. indica, limited insight is available with regard to gaining in-depth knowledge of the interaction mechanisms between the host and pathogen proteins during the disease infection process. Here, we report the development of a comprehensive database and webserver, TritiKBdb, that implements various tools to study the protein-protein interactions in the Triticum species-Tilletia indica pathosystem. The novel 'interactomics' tool allows the user to visualize/compare the networks of the predicted interactions in an enriched manner. TritiKBdb is a user-friendly database that provides functional annotations such as subcellular localization, available domains, KEGG pathways, and GO terms of the host and pathogen proteins. Additionally, the information about the host and pathogen proteins that serve as transcription factors and effectors, respectively, is also made available.

"35658913","WeCoNET: a host-pathogen interactome database for deciphering crucial molecular networks of wheat-common bunt cross-talk mechanisms. Background Triticum aestivum is the most important staple food grain of the world. In recent years, the outbreak of a major seed-borne disease, common bunt, in wheat resulted in reduced quality and quantity of the crop. The disease is caused by two fungal pathogens, Tilletia caries and Tilletia laevis, which show high similarity to each other in terms of life cycle, germination, and disease symptoms. The host-pathogen protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in initiating the disease infection mechanism as well as in plant defense responses. Due to the availability of limited information on Tilletia species, the elucidation of infection mechanisms is hampered. Results We constructed a database WeCoNET ( http://bioinfo.usu.edu/weconet/ ), providing functional annotations of the pathogen proteins and various tools to exploit host-pathogen interactions and other relevant information. The database implements a host-pathogen interactomics tool to predict protein-protein interactions, followed by network visualization, BLAST search tool, advanced 'keywords-based' search module, etc. Other features in the database include various functional annotations of host and pathogen proteins such as gene ontology terms, functional domains, and subcellular localization. The pathogen proteins that serve as effector and secretory proteins have also been incorporated in the database, along with their respective descriptions. Additionally, the host proteins that serve as transcription factors were predicted, and are available along with the respective transcription factor family and KEGG pathway to which they belong. Conclusion WeCoNET is a comprehensive, efficient resource to the molecular biologists engaged in understanding the molecular mechanisms behind the common bunt infection in wheat. The data integrated into the database can also be beneficial to the breeders for the development of common bunt-resistant cultivars.","6/3/2022","http://bioinfo.usu.edu/weconet","WeCoNET",0.997436165809631,"",0,"WeCoNET",0.997436166,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37992195","DegronMD: Leveraging Evolutionary and Structural Features for Deciphering Protein-Targeted Degradation, Mutations, and Drug Response to Degrons. Protein-targeted degradation is an emerging and promising therapeutic approach. The specificity of degradation and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis are determined by the interactions between E3 ubiquitin ligase and degradation signals, known as degrons. The human genome encodes over 600 E3 ligases; however, only a small number of targeted degron instances have been identified so far. In this study, we introduced DegronMD, an open knowledgebase designed for the investigation of degrons, their associated dysfunctional events, and drug responses. We revealed that degrons are evolutionarily conserved and tend to occur near the sites of protein translational modifications, particularly in the regions of disordered structure and higher solvent accessibility. Through pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we constructed the degrome landscape across the human proteome, yielding over 18,000 new degrons for targeted protein degradation. Furthermore, dysfunction of degrons disrupts the degradation process and leads to the abnormal accumulation of proteins; this process is associated with various types of human cancers. Based on the estimated phenotypic changes induced by somatic mutations, we systematically quantified and assessed the impact of mutations on degron function in pan-cancers; these results helped to build a global mutational map on human degrome, including 89,318 actionable mutations that may induce the dysfunction of degrons and disrupt protein degradation pathways. Multiomics integrative analysis unveiled over 400 drug resistance events associated with the mutations in functional degrons. DegronMD, accessible at https://bioinfo.uth.edu/degronmd, is a useful resource to explore the biological mechanisms, infer protein degradation, and assist with drug discovery and design on degrons.","12/1/2023","http://bioinfo.uth.edu/degronmd","DegronMD",0.988399863,"",0,"DegronMD",0.9883998632,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"35660007","WheatCENet: A Database for Comparative Co-expression Networks Analysis of Allohexaploid Wheat and Its Progenitors. Genetic and epigenetic changes after polyploidization events could result in variable gene expression and modified regulatory networks. Here, using large-scale transcriptome data, we constructed co-expression networks for diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat species, and built a platform for comparing co-expression networks of allohexaploid wheat and its progenitors, named WheatCENet. WheatCENet is a platform for searching and comparing specific functional co-expression networks, as well as identifying the related functions of the genes clustered therein. Functional annotations like pathways, gene families, protein-protein interactions, microRNAs (miRNAs), and several lines of epigenome data are integrated into this platform, and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), motif identification, and other useful tools are also included. Using WheatCENet, we found that the network of WHEAT ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (WAPO1) has more co-expressed genes related to spike development in hexaploid wheat than its progenitors. We also found a novel motif of CCWWWWWWGG (CArG) specifically in the promoter region of WAPO-A1, suggesting that neofunctionalization of the WAPO-A1 gene affects spikelet development in hexaploid wheat. WheatCENet is useful for investigating co-expression networks and conducting other analyses, and thus facilitates comparative and functional genomic studies in wheat.

"36950350","PlantLTRdb: An interactive database for 195 plant species LTR-retrotransposons. LTR-retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are a large group of transposable elements that replicate through an RNA intermediate and alter genome structure. The activities of LTR-RTs in plant genomes provide helpful information about genome evolution and gene function. LTR-RTs near or within genes can directly alter gene function. This work introduces PlantLTRdb, an intact LTR-RT database for 195 plant species. Using homology- and de novo structure-based methods, a total of 150.18 Gbp representing 3,079,469 pseudomolecules/scaffolds were analyzed to identify, characterize, annotate LTR-RTs, estimate insertion ages, detect LTR-RT-gene chimeras, and determine nearby genes. Accordingly, 520,194 intact LTR-RTs were discovered, including 29,462 autonomous and 490,732 nonautonomous LTR-RTs. The autonomous LTR-RTs included 10,286 Gypsy and 19,176 Copia, while the nonautonomous were divided into 224,906 Gypsy, 218,414 Copia, 1,768 BARE-2, 3,147 TR-GAG and 4,2497 unknown. Analysis of the identified LTR-RTs located within genes showed that a total of 36,236 LTR-RTs were LTR-RT-gene chimeras and 11,619 LTR-RTs were within pseudo-genes. In addition, 50,026 genes are within 1 kbp of LTR-RTs, and 250,587 had a distance of 1 to 10 kbp from LTR-RTs. PlantLTRdb allows researchers to search, visualize, BLAST and analyze plant LTR-RTs. PlantLTRdb can contribute to the understanding of structural variations, genome organization, functional genomics, and the development of LTR-RT target markers for molecular plant breeding.

Here, 8,768,261 scaffolds/chromosomes containing 229,093 giga-base pairs representing whole-genome sequences of 256 plant species were analyzed to identify tRNA genes. As a result, 331,242 nuclear, 3,216 chloroplast, and 1,467 mitochondrial tRNA genes were identified. The nuclear tRNA genes include 275,134 tRNAs decoding 20 standard amino acids, 1,325 suppressor tRNAs, 6,273 tRNAs with unknown isotypes, 48,475 predicted pseudogenes, and 37,873 tRNAs with introns.

"37646936","TEMM: A Curated Data Resource for Transposon Element-Based Molecular Markers in Plants. Transposon elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that can insert themselves into new locations and modify the plant genome. In recent years, they have been used as molecular markers in plant breeding programs. TE-based molecular markers (TE-markers) are divided into two categories depending on the transcription mechanism of the TEs. The first category is retrotransposon-based molecular markers, which include RBIP, IRAP, REMAP, and iPBS. The second group is DNA-based-TE-markers, which include MITE, TE-junction, and CACTA TE-markers. These markers are a good tool for studying genetic diversity and can provide information on plants' phylogenetic and evolutionary history. They can help improve breeding programs to increase agronomic traits and develop new varieties. Overall, TE-markers play an important role in plant genetics and plant breeding and contribute to a better understanding of plant biology. Here, we present TEMM, a curated data resource for TE-markers in plants. Relevant research articles were screened to collect primer sequences and related information. Only articles containing primer sequences are added to the present data resource. TEMM contains 784 primers with their associated PCR reaction programs and their applications in various crops. These include 203 IPBS, 191 RBIP, 140 IRAP, 78 TE-junction, 76 IRAPS, 47 RBIP-IRAP, 16 IRAP-REMAP, 12 REMAP, 12 REMA-IRAP, 6 REMA, and 3 ISBP primers.

In this work, we developed a user-friendly AAgAtlas portal (http://biokb.ncpsb.org.cn/aagatlas_portal/index.php#), which can be used to search for 8045 non-redundant autoantigens (AAgs) and 47 post-translationally modified AAgs against 1073 human diseases that are prioritized by a credential score developed by multisource evidence. Using AAgAtlas, the immunogenic properties of human AAgs was systematically elucidated according to their genetic, biophysical, cytological, expression profile, and evolutionary characteristics. The results indicated that human AAgs are evolutionally conserved in protein sequence and enriched in three hydrophilic and polar amino acid residues (K, D, and E) that are located at the protein surface. AAgs are enriched in proteins that are involved in nucleic acid binding, transferase, and the cytoskeleton. Genome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses further indicated that AAb production is associated with gene variance and abnormal protein expression related to the pathological activities of different tumors. Collectively, our data outlines the hallmarks of human AAgs that facilitate the understanding of humoral autoimmunity and the identification of biomarkers of human diseases.","5/14/2023","http://biokb.ncpsb.org.cn/aagatlas_portal/index.php","AAgAtlas",0.996369659900665,"Human Autoantigen Atlas",0.694618344306946,"AAgAtlas",0.99636966,1,"","27924021, 32162267","","","","merge all ""dup name"" IDs","",NA,""

"37415294","Characterizing RNA-binding ligands on structures, chemical information, binding affinity and drug-likeness. Recent studies suggest RNAs act as promising drug targets. However, limited development has been achieved in detecting RNA-ligand interactions. To guide the discovery of RNA-binding ligands, it is necessary to characterize them comprehensively, especially in the binding specificity, binding affinity and drug-like properties. We established a database, RNALID (http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/RNALID/html/index.html#/database), which collects RNA-ligand interactions validated by low-throughput experiment. RNALID contains 358 RNA-ligand interactions. Comparing to the fellow database, 94.5% of ligands in RNALID are completely or partially novel collections, and 51.78% have novel two-dimensional (2D) structures. Through the analysis of ligand structure, binding affinity and cheminformatic parameters we found that multivalent (MV) ligands mainly binding to RNA repeats are more structurally conserved in both 2D and 3D structures than other ligand types, exhibit higher binding specificity and binding affinity than ligands binding to non-repeat RNAs, but deviate far from the Lipinski's rule of five. In contrary, small molecule (SM) ligands binding to virus RNA exhibit higher affinity and more resemble protein-ligands, but potentially possess low binding specificity. Further analysis on 28 detailed drug-likeness properties indicated that RNA-ligands' development need to balance between the binding affinity and the drug-likeness because of the significant linear co-relationship between the two. Comparing RNALID ligands to FDA-approved drugs and ligands without bioactivity indicated that RNA-binding ligands are different from them in chemical properties, structural properties and drug-likeness. Thus, characterizing the RNA-ligand interactions in RNALID in multiple respects provides new insights into discovering and designing druggable ligands binding with RNA.","1/1/2023","http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/RNALID/html/index.html","RNALID",0.995752573013306,"",0,"RNALID",0.995752573,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has caused a global health crisis.

SARS-CoV-2-infected in vitro model, allows easy control of the experimental conditions, obtaining reproducible results, and monitoring of infection progression. Currently, accumulating RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 in vitro models urgently needs systematic translation and interpretation. To fill this gap, we built COVIDanno, COVID-19 annotation in humans, available at http://biomedbdc.wchscu.cn/COVIDanno/. The aim of this resource is to provide a reference resource of intensive functional annotations of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among different time points of COVID-19 infection in human in vitro models. To do this, we performed differential expression analysis for 136 individual datasets across 13 tissue types. In total, we identified 4,935 DEGs. We performed multiple bioinformatics/computational biology studies for these DEGs. Furthermore, we developed a novel tool to help users predict the status of SARS-CoV-2 infection for a given sample.

"37486750","DCABM-TCM: A Database of Constituents Absorbed into the Blood and Metabolites of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) not only maintains the health of Asian people but also provides a great resource of active natural products for modern drug development. Herein, we developed a Database of Constituents Absorbed into the Blood and Metabolites of TCM (DCABM-TCM), the first database systematically collecting blood constituents of TCM prescriptions and herbs, including prototypes and metabolites experimentally detected in the blood, together with the corresponding detailed detection conditions through manual literature mining. The DCABM-TCM has collected 1816 blood constituents with chemical structures of 192 prescriptions and 194 herbs and integrated their related annotations, including physicochemical, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties, and associated targets, pathways, and diseases. Furthermore, the DCABM-TCM supported two blood constituent-based analysis functions, the network pharmacology analysis for TCM molecular mechanism elucidation, and the target/pathway/disease-based screening of candidate blood constituents, herbs, or prescriptions for TCM-based drug discovery. The DCABM-TCM is freely accessible at http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/dcabm-tcm/. The DCABM-TCM will contribute to the elucidation of effective constituents and molecular mechanism of TCMs and the discovery of TCM-derived drug-like compounds that are both bioactive and bioavailable.","7/24/2023","http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/dcabm-tcm","DCABM-TCM",0.992538839578628,"of Constituents Absorbed into the Blood and Metabolites of TCM",0.770170520333683,"DCABM-TCM",0.99253884,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37399251","Online data resource for exploring transposon insertion polymorphisms in public soybean germplasm accessions. Soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) is one of the most important economical crops. A large number of whole-genome resequencing datasets have been generated and are increasingly expanded for exploring genetic diversity and mining important quantitative trait loci. Most genome-wide association studies have focused on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, short insertions, and deletions. Nevertheless, structure variants mainly caused by transposon element mobilization are not fully considered. To fill this gap, we uniformly processed the publicly available whole-genome resequencing data from 5,521 soybean germplasm accessions and built an online soybean transposon insertion polymorphisms database named Soybean Transposon Insertion Polymorphisms Database (SoyTIPdb) (https://biotec.njau.edu.cn/soytipdb). The collected germplasm accessions derived from more than 45 countries and 160 regions representing the most comprehensive genetic diversity of soybean. SoyTIPdb implements easy-to-use query, analysis, and browse functions to help understand and find meaningful structural variations from TE insertions.

"37582413","The ESTHER database on alpha/beta hydrolase fold proteins - An overview of recent developments. The ESTHER database, dedicated to ESTerases and alpha/beta-Hydrolase Enzymes and Relatives (https://bioweb.supagro.inra.fr/ESTHER/general?what=index), offers online access to a continuously updated, sequence-based classification of proteins harboring the alpha/beta hydrolase fold into families and subfamilies. In particular, the database proposes links to the sequences, structures, ligands and huge diversity of functions of these proteins, and to the related literature and other databases. Taking advantage of the promiscuity of enzymatic function, many engineered esterases, lipases, epoxide-hydrolases, haloalkane dehalogenases are used for biotechnological applications. Finding means for detoxifying those protein members that are targeted by insecticides, herbicides, antibiotics, or for reactivating human cholinesterases when inhibited by nerve gas, are still active areas of research. Using or improving the capacity of some enzymes to breakdown plastics with the aim to recycle valuable material and reduce waste is an emerging challenge. Most hydrolases in the superfamily are water-soluble and act on or are inhibited by small organic compounds, yet in a few subfamilies some members interact with other, unrelated proteins to modulate activity or trigger functional partnerships. Recent development in 3D structure prediction brought by AI-based programs now permits analysis of enzymatic mechanisms for a variety of hydrolases with no experimental 3D structure available. Finally, mutations in as many as 34 of the 120 human genes compiled in the database are now linked to genetic diseases, a feature fueling research on early detection, metabolic pathways, pharmacological treatment or enzyme replacement therapy. Here we review those developments in the database that took place over the latest decade and discuss potential new applications and recent and future expected research in the field.","8/13/2023","http://bioweb.supagro.inra.fr/ESTHER/general?what=index","ESTHER",0.995459675788879,"",0,"ESTHER",0.995459676,1,"","23193256","","","","merge all ""dup name"" IDs","",NA,""

"34500462","ViMIC: a database of human disease-related virus mutations, integration sites and cis-effects. Molecular mechanisms of virus-related diseases involve multiple factors, including viral mutation accumulation and integration of a viral genome into the host DNA. With increasing attention being paid to virus-mediated pathogenesis and the development of many useful technologies to identify virus mutations (VMs) and viral integration sites (VISs), much research on these topics is available in PubMed. However, knowledge of VMs and VISs is widely scattered in numerous published papers which lack standardization, integration and curation. To address these challenges, we built a pilot database of human disease-related Virus Mutations, Integration sites and Cis-effects (ViMIC), which specializes in three features: virus mutation sites, viral integration sites and target genes. In total, the ViMIC provides information on 31 712 VMs entries, 105 624 VISs, 16 310 viral target genes and 1 110 015 virus sequences of eight viruses in 77 human diseases obtained from the public domain.

The Brassicaceae Database (BRAD version 3.0, BRAD V3.0; http://brassicadb.cn) has evolved from the former Brassica Database (BRAD V2.0), and represents an important community portal hosting genome information for multiple Brassica and related Brassicaceae plant species. Since the last update in 2015, the complex genomes of numerous Brassicaceae species have been decoded, accompanied by many omics datasets. To provide an up-to-date service, we report here a major upgrade of the portal. The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) framework of BRAD has been re-engineered to enable easy and sustainable maintenance of the database. The collection of genomes has been increased to 26 species, along with optimization of the user interface.

"35281847","CerealESTDb: A Comprehensive Resource for Abiotic Stress-Responsive Annotated ESTs With Predicted Genes, Gene Ontology, and Metabolic Pathways in Major Cereal Crops. Cereals are the most important food crops and are considered key contributors to global food security. Loss due to abiotic stresses in cereal crops is limiting potential productivity in a significant manner. The primary reasons for abiotic stresses are abrupt temperature, variable rainfall, and declining nutrient status of the soil. Varietal development is the key to sustaining productivity under influence of multiple abiotic stresses and must be studied in context with genomics and molecular breeding. Recently, advances in a plethora of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based methods have accelerated the enormous genomic data generation associated with stress-induced transcripts such as microarray, RNAseq, Expressed Sequenced Tag (ESTs), etc. Many databases related to microarray and RNA-seq based transcripts have been developed and profusely utilized. However, an abundant amount of transcripts related to abiotic stresses in various cereal crops arising from EST technology are available but still remain underutilized in absence of a consolidated database. In this study, an attempt has been made with a primary goal to integrate, analyse, and characterise the available resources of ESTs responsive to abiotic stresses in major cereals. The developed CerealESTdb presents a customisable search in two different ways in the form of searchable content for easy access and potential use. This database comprises ESTs from four major cereal crops, namely rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolour L.), and maize (Zea mays L.), under a set of abiotic stresses. The current statistics of this cohesive database consists of 55,826 assembled EST sequences, 51,791 predicted genes models, and their 254,609 gene ontology terms including extensive information on 1,746 associated metabolic pathways. We anticipate that developed CerealESTdb will be helpful in deciphering the knowledge of complex biological phenomena under abiotic stresses to accelerate the molecular breeding programs towards the development of crop cultivars resilient to abiotic stresses.

"35646870","CAD v1.0: Cancer Antigens Database Platform for Cancer Antigen Algorithm Development and Information Exploration. Cancer vaccines have gradually attracted attention for their tremendous preclinical and clinical performance. With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies and related algorithms, pipelines based on sequencing and machine learning methods have become mainstream in cancer antigen prediction; of particular focus are neoantigens, mutation peptides that only exist in tumor cells that lack central tolerance and have fewer side effects. The rapid prediction and filtering of neoantigen peptides are crucial to the development of neoantigen-based cancer vaccines. However, due to the lack of verified neoantigen datasets and insufficient research on the properties of neoantigens, neoantigen prediction algorithms still need to be improved. Here, we recruited verified cancer antigen peptides and collected as much relevant peptide information as possible. Then, we discussed the role of each dataset for algorithm improvement in cancer antigen research, especially neoantigen prediction.

As one of the most essential components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) interact extensively with cancer cells and other stromal cells to remodel TME and participate in the pathogenesis of cancer, which earmarked themselves as new promising targets for cancer therapy. Numerous studies have highlighted the heterogeneity and versatility of CAFs in most cancer types. Thus, the identification and appropriate use of CAF-related genes (CAFGenes) in the context of specific cancer types will provide critical insights into disease mechanisms and CAF-related therapeutic targets.

Esophageal cancer is the seventh most prevalent and the sixth most lethal cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the major esophageal cancer subtypes that accounts for 87 % of the total cases. However, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present an integrated database for ESCC called ESCCdb, which includes a total of 56 datasets and published studies from the GEO, Xena or SRA databases and related publications. It helps users to explore a particular gene with multiple graphical and interactive views with one click. The results comprise expression changes across 20 datasets, copy number alterations in 11 datasets, somatic mutations from 12 papers, related drugs derived from DGIdb, related pathways, and gene correlations. ESCCdb enables directly cross-dataset comparison of a gene's mutations, expressions and copy number changes in multiple datasets. This allows users to easily assess the alterations in ESCC. Furthermore, survival analysis, drug-gene relationships, and results from whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screening can help users determine the clinical relevance, derive functional inferences, and identify potential drugs. Notably, ESCCdb also enables the exploration of the correlation structure and identification of potential key regulators for a process. Finally, we identified 789 consistently differential expressed genes; we summarized recurrently mutated genes and genes affected by significant copy number alterations. These genes may be stable biomarkers or important players during ESCC development.

Several new methods and tools have been continuously developed, making it extremely tricky to navigate this research landscape and develop an up-to-date workflow to analyze single-cell sequencing data, particularly for researchers seeking to enter this field without computational experience. Moreover, choosing appropriate tools and optimal parameters to meet the demands of researchers represents a major challenge in processing single-cell sequencing data. However, a specific resource for easy access to detailed information on single-cell sequencing methods and data processing pipelines is still lacking. In the present study, an online resource called SingleScan was developed to curate all up-to-date single-cell transcriptome/genome analyzing tools and pipelines. All the available tools were categorized according to their main tasks, and several typical workflows for single-cell data analysis were summarized.

"37337236","The Cameroon Health Research and Evidence Database (CAMHRED): tools and methods for local evidence mapping. Background Local evidence is important for contextualized knowledge translation. It can be used to adapt global recommendations, to identify future research priorities and inform local policy decisions. However, there are challenges in identifying local evidence in a systematic, comprehensive, and timely manner. There is limited guidance on how to map local evidence and provide it to users in an accessible and user-friendly way. In this study, we address these issues by describing the methods for the development of a centralized database of health research evidence for Cameroon and its applications for research prioritization and decision making. Methods We searched 10 electronic health databases and hand-searched the archives of non-indexed African and Cameroonian journals. We screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of peer reviewed journal articles published between 1999 and 2019 in English or French that assess health related outcomes in Cameroonian populations. We extracted relevant study characteristics based on a pre-established guide. We developed a coding scheme or taxonomy of content areas so that local evidence is mapped to corresponding domains and subdomains. Pairs of reviewers coded articles independently and resolved discrepancies by consensus. Moreover, we developed guidance on how to search the database, use search results to create evidence maps and conduct knowledge gap analyses. Results The Cameroon Health Research and Evidence Database (CAMHRED) is a bilingual centralized online portal of local evidence on health in Cameroon from 1999 onwards. It currently includes 4384 studies categorized into content domains and study characteristics (design, setting, year and language of publication). The database is searchable by keywords or through a guided search. Results including abstracts, relevant study characteristics and bibliographic information are available for users to download. Upon request, guidance on how to optimize search results for applications like evidence maps and knowledge gap analyses is also available. Conclusions CAMHRED ( https://camhred.org/ ) is a systematic, comprehensive, and centralized resource for local evidence about health in Cameroon. It is freely available to stakeholders and provides an additional resource to support their work at various levels in the research process.","6/19/2023","http://camhred.org","CAMHRED",0.988834667205811,"Cameroon Health Research and Evidence Database",0.954938610394796,"CAMHRED",0.988834667,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"36370097","CAMPR4: a database of natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides. There has been an exponential increase in the design of synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) for its use as novel antibiotics. Synthetic AMPs are substantially enriched in residues with physicochemical properties known to be critical for antimicrobial activity; such as positive charge, hydrophobicity, and higher alpha helical propensity. The current prediction algorithms for AMPs have been developed using AMP sequences from natural sources and hence do not perform well for synthetic peptides. In this version of CAMP database, along with updating sequence information of AMPs, we have created separate prediction algorithms for natural and synthetic AMPs. CAMPR4 holds 24243 AMP sequences, 933 structures, 2143 patents and 263 AMP family signatures.

"37351774","Canis MitoSNP database: a functional tool useful for comparative analyses of human and canine mitochondrial genomes. Canis MitoSNP is a tool allowing assignment of each mitochondrial genomic position a corresponding position in the mitochondrial gene and in the structure of tRNA, rRNA, and protein. The main aim of this bioinformatic tool was to use data from other bioinformatic tools (TMHMM, SOPMA, tRNA-SCAN, RNAfold, ConSurf) for dog and human mitochondrial genes in order to shorten the time necessary for the analysis of the whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as well as amino acid and protein analyses. Each position in the canine mitochondrial genome is assigned a position in genes, in codons, an amino acid position in proteins, or a position in tRNA or rRNA molecules. Therefore, a user analysing changes in the canine and human mitochondrial genome does not need to extract the sequences of individual genes from the mitochondrial genome for analysis and there is no need to rewrite them into amino acid sequences to assess whether the change is synonymous or nonsynonymous. Canis mitoSNP allows the comparison between the human and canine mitochondrial genomes as well. The Clustal W alignment of the dog and human mitochondrial DNA reference sequences for each gene obtained from GenBank (NC_002008.4 dog, NC_012920.1 human) was performed in order to determine which position in the canine mitochondrial genome corresponds to the position in the human mitochondrial genome.

"35230424","DSDBASE 2.0: updated version of DiSulphide dataBASE, a database on disulphide bonds in proteins. Disulphide bonds are stabilizing crosslinks in proteins and serve to enhance their thermal stability. In proteins that are small and rich in disulphide bonds, they could be the major determining factor for the choice of conformational state since their constraints on appropriate backbone conformation can be substantial. Such crosslinks and their positional conservation could itself enable protein family and functional association. Despite the importance of the field, there is no comprehensive database on disulphide crosslinks that is available to the public. Herein we provide information on disulphides in DSDBASE2.0, an updated and significantly expanded database that is freely available, fully annotated and manually curated database on native and modelled disulphides. The web interface also provides several useful computational tools that have been specifically developed for proteins containing disulphide crosslinks. The modelling of disulphide crosslinks is performed using stereochemical criteria, coded within our Modelling of Disulphides in Proteins (MODIP) algorithm. The inclusion of modelled disulphides potentially enhances the loop database substantially, thereby permitting the recognition of compatible polypeptide segments that could serve as templates for immediate modelling. The DSDBASE2.0 database has been updated to include 153,944 PDB entries, 216,096 native and 20,153,850 modelled disulphide bond segments from PDB January 2021 release. The current database also provides a resource to user-friendly search for multiple disulphide bond containing loops, along with annotation of their function using GO and subcellular localization of the query. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain the three-dimensional models of disulphide-rich small proteins using an independent algorithm, RANMOD, that generates and examines random, but allowed backbone conformations of the polypeptide. DSDBASE2.0 still remains the largest open-access repository that organizes all disulphide bonds of proteins on a single platform.

"35411388","PASS2.7: a database containing structure-based sequence alignments and associated features of protein domain superfamilies from SCOPe. Sequence alignments are models that capture the structural, functional and evolutionary relationships between proteins. Structure-guided sequence alignments are helpful in the case of distantly related proteins with poor sequence identity, thus rendering routine sequence alignment methods ineffective. Protein Alignment organized as Structural Superfamilies or PASS2 database provides such sequence alignments of protein domains within a superfamily as per the Structural Classification of Proteins extended (SCOPe) database. The current update of PASS2 (i.e. PASS2.7) is following the latest release of SCOPe (2.07) and we provide data for 14√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â323 protein domains that are <40% identical and are organized into 2024 superfamilies.

"35898309","CARs-DB: A Database of Cryptic Amyloidogenic Regions in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins. Proteome-wide analyses suggest that most globular proteins contain at least one amyloidogenic region, whereas these aggregation-prone segments are thought to be underrepresented in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In recent work, we reported that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) indeed sustain a significant amyloid load in the form of cryptic amyloidogenic regions (CARs). CARs are widespread in IDRs, but they are necessarily exposed to solvent, and thus they should be more polar and have a milder aggregation potential than conventional amyloid regions protected inside globular proteins. CARs are connected with IDPs function and, in particular, with the establishment of protein-protein interactions through their IDRs. However, their presence also appears associated with pathologies like cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Given the relevance of CARs for both IDPs function and malfunction, we developed CARs-DB, a database containing precomputed predictions for all CARs present in the IDPs deposited in the DisProt database. This web tool allows for the fast and comprehensive exploration of previously unnoticed amyloidogenic regions embedded within IDRs sequences and might turn helpful in identifying disordered interacting regions. It contains >8,900 unique CARs identified in a total of 1711 IDRs. CARs-DB is freely available for users and can be accessed at http://carsdb.ppmclab.com.

"37030102","EPEK: Creation and analysis of an Ectopic Pregnancy Expression Knowledgebase. Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, where the fertilized embryo grows outside of the uterus. Recent experiments on mice have uncovered the importance of genetic factors in the transport of embryos inside the uterus. In the past, efforts have been made to identify possible gene or protein markers in EP in humans through multiple expression studies. Although there exist comprehensive gene resources for other maternal health disorders, there is no specific resource that compiles the genes associated with EP from such expression studies. Here, we address that knowledge gap by creating a computational resource, Ectopic Pregnancy Expression Knowledgebase (EPEK), that involves manual compilation and curation of expression profiles of EP in humans from published articles. In EPEK, we compiled information on 314 differentially expressed genes, 17 metabolites, and 3 SNPs associated with EP. Computational analyses on the gene set from EPEK showed the implication of cellular signaling processes in EP. We also identified possible exosome markers that could be clinically relevant in the diagnosis of EP.

"38160837","ViCEKb: Vitiligo-linked Chemical Exposome Knowledgebase. Vitiligo is a complex disease wherein the environmental factors, in conjunction with the underlying genetic predispositions, trigger the autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, ultimately leading to depigmented patches on the skin. While genetic factors have been extensively studied, the knowledge on environmental triggers remains sparse and less understood. To address this knowledge gap, we present the first comprehensive knowledgebase of vitiligo-triggering chemicals namely, Vitiligo-linked Chemical Exposome Knowledgebase (ViCEKb). ViCEKb involves an extensive and systematic manual effort in curation of published literature and subsequent compilation of 113 unique chemical triggers of vitiligo. ViCEKb standardizes various chemical information, and categorizes the chemicals based on their evidences and sources of exposure. Importantly, ViCEKb contains a wide range of metrics necessary for different toxicological evaluations. Notably, we observed that ViCEKb chemicals are present in a variety of consumer products. For instance, Propyl gallate is present as a fragrance substance in various household products, and Flutamide is used in medication to treat prostate cancer. These two chemicals have the highest level of evidence in ViCEKb, but are not regulated for their skin sensitizing effects. Furthermore, an extensive cheminformatics-based investigation revealed that ViCEKb chemical space is structurally diverse and comprises unique chemical scaffolds in comparison with skin specific regulatory lists. For example, Neomycin and 2,3,5-Triglycidyl-4-aminophenol have unique chemical scaffolds and the highest level of evidence in ViCEKb, but are not regulated for their skin sensitizing effects. Finally, a transcriptomics-based analysis of ViCEKb chemical perturbations in skin cell samples highlighted the commonality in their linked biological processes. Overall, we present the first comprehensive effort in compilation and exploration of various chemical triggers of vitiligo. We believe such a resource will enable in deciphering the complex etiology of vitiligo and aid in the characterization of human chemical exposome.

"37435612","CBP60-DB: An AlphaFold-predicted plant kingdom-wide database of the CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN 60 protein family with a novel structural clustering algorithm. Molecular genetic analyses in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana have demonstrated the major roles of different CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN 60 (CBP60) proteins in growth, stress signaling, and immune responses. Prominently, CBP60g and SARD1 are paralogous CBP60 transcription factors that regulate numerous components of the immune system, such as cell surface and intracellular immune receptors, MAP kinases, WRKY transcription factors, and biosynthetic enzymes for immunity-activating metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). However, their function, regulation, and diversification in most species remain unclear. Here, we have created CBP60-DB (https://cbp60db.wlu.ca/), a structural and bioinformatic database that comprehensively characterized 1052 CBP60 gene homologs (encoding 2376 unique transcripts and 1996 unique proteins) across 62 phylogenetically diverse genomes in the plant kingdom. We have employed deep learning-predicted structural analyses using AlphaFold2 and then generated dedicated web pages for all plant CBP60 proteins. Importantly, we have generated a novel clustering visualization algorithm to interrogate kingdom-wide structural similarities for more efficient inference of conserved functions across various plant taxa. Because well-characterized CBP60 proteins in Arabidopsis are known to be transcription factors with putative calmodulin-binding domains, we have integrated external bioinformatic resources to analyze protein domains and motifs. Collectively, we present a plant kingdom-wide identification of this important protein family in a user-friendly AlphaFold-anchored database, representing a novel and significant resource for the broader plant biology community.","7/9/2023","http://cbp60db.wlu.ca","CBP60-DB",0.922940003871918,"",0,"CBP60-DB",0.922940004,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"37646942","The Chromosome Counts Database (CCDB). For decades, plant biologists have been interested in the determination and documentation of chromosome numbers for extant taxa. This central cytological character has been used as an important phylogenetic marker and as an indicator for major genomic events such as polyploidy and dysploidy. Due to their significance and the relative ease by which chromosome numbers can be obtained, chromosome numbers have been extensively recorded across the plant kingdom and documented in a wide variety of resources. This makes the collection process a wearing task, often leading to partial data retrieval. In 2015, the Chromosome Counts Database (CCDB) was assembled, being an online unified community resource. This database compiles dozens of different chromosome counts sources, of which a significant portion had been unavailable before in a digitized, searchable format. The vast amount of data assembled in CCDB has already enabled a large number of analyses to examine the evolution of different plant hierarchies, as well as the application of various follow-up analyses, such as ploidy-level inference using chromEvol.

Cell-cell interaction (CCI) is a crucial event in the development and function of multicellular organisms. The development of CCI databases is beneficial for researchers who want to analyze single-cell sequencing data or study CCI through molecular experiments. CCIs are known to act differently according to cellular and biological contexts such as cell types, gene mutations or disease status; however, previous CCI databases do not completely provide this contextual information pertaining to CCIs. We constructed a cell-cell interaction database (CCIDB) containing the biological and clinical contexts involved in each interaction. To build a database of cellular and tissue contexts, we collected 38 types of context features, which were categorized into seven categories, including 'interaction', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'effector', 'phenotype', 'pathology' and 'reference'. CCIs were manually retrieved from 272 studies published recently (less than 6 years ago). In the current version of CCIDB, 520 CCIs and their 38 context features have been manually collected and curated by biodata engineers.

To do this, we collected 15 900 lncRNAs across 33 cancer types from TCGA. For individual lncRNAs, we performed multiple interaction analyses of different biomolecules including DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Our intensive studies of lncRNAs provide diverse potential mechanisms of lncRNAs that regulate gene expression through binding enhancers and 3'-UTRs of genes, competing for miRNA binding sites with mRNAs, recruiting the transcription factors to gene promoters. Furthermore, we investigated lncRNAs that potentially affect the alternative splicing events through interacting with RNA binding Proteins. We also performed multiple functional annotations including cancer stage-associated lncRNAs, RNA A-to-I editing event-associated lncRNAs, and lncRNA expression quantitative trait loci. lncRNAfunc is a unique resource for cancer research communities to help better understand potential lncRNA regulations and therapeutic lncRNA targets.","1/1/2022","http://ccsm.uth.edu/lncRNAfunc","lncRNAfunc",0.997836709,"",0,"lncRNAfunc",0.997836709,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

In recent years, the explosive growth of spatial technologies has enabled the characterization of spatial heterogeneity of tissue architectures.

Even though two spatial transcriptomics databases exist, they provide limited analytical information. Information such as spatial heterogeneity of genes and cells, cell-cell communication activities in space, and the cell type compositions in the microenvironment are critical clues to unveil the mechanism of tumorigenesis and embryo differentiation. Therefore, we constructed a new spatial transcriptomics database, named SPASCER (https://ccsm.uth.edu/SPASCER), designed to help understand the heterogeneity of tissue organizations, region-specific microenvironment, and intercellular interactions across tissue architectures at multiple levels. SPASCER contains datasets from 43 studies, including 1082 sub-datasets from 16 organ types across four species. scRNA-seq was integrated to deconvolve/map spatial transcriptomics, and processed with spatial cell-cell interaction, gene pattern and pathway enrichment analysis.

In the realm of unraveling COVID-19's intricacies, numerous metabolomic investigations have been conducted to discern the unique metabolic traits exhibited within infected patients. These endeavors have yielded a substantial reservoir of potential data pertaining to metabolic biomarkers linked to the virus. Despite these strides, a comprehensive and meticulously structured database housing these crucial biomarkers remains absent. In this study, we developed MetaboliteCOVID, a manually curated database of COVID-19-related metabolite markers. The database currently comprises 665 manually selected entries of significantly altered metabolites associated with early diagnosis, disease severity, prognosis, and drug response in COVID-19, encompassing 337 metabolites. Additionally, the database offers a user-friendly interface, containing abundant information for querying, browsing, and analyzing COVID-19-related abnormal metabolites in different body fluids. In summary, we believe that this database will effectively facilitate research on the functions and mechanisms of COVID-19-related metabolic biomarkers, thereby advancing both basic and clinical research on COVID-19.

"36760531","CellPalmSeq: A curated RNAseq database of palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzyme expression in human cell types and laboratory cell lines. The reversible lipid modification protein S-palmitoylation can dynamically modify the localization, diffusion, function, conformation and physical interactions of substrate proteins. Dysregulated S-palmitoylation is associated with a multitude of human diseases including brain and metabolic disorders, viral infection and cancer. However, the diverse expression patterns of the genes that regulate palmitoylation in the broad range of human cell types are currently unexplored, and their expression in commonly used cell lines that are the workhorse of basic and preclinical research are often overlooked when studying palmitoylation dependent processes. We therefore created CellPalmSeq (https://cellpalmseq.med.ubc.ca), a curated RNAseq database and interactive webtool for visualization of the expression patterns of the genes that regulate palmitoylation across human single cell types, bulk tissue, cancer cell lines and commonly used laboratory non-human cell lines. This resource will allow exploration of these expression patterns, revealing important insights into cellular physiology and disease, and will aid with cell line selection and the interpretation of results when studying important cellular processes that depend on protein S-palmitoylation.","1/24/2023","http://cellpalmseq.med.ubc.ca","CellPalmSeq",0.997925758361816,"",0,"CellPalmSeq",0.997925758,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37207327","ResFinderFG v2.0: a database of antibiotic resistance genes obtained by functional metagenomics. Metagenomics can be used to monitor the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). ARGs found in databases such as ResFinder and CARD primarily originate from culturable and pathogenic bacteria, while ARGs from non-culturable and non-pathogenic bacteria remain understudied. Functional metagenomics is based on phenotypic gene selection and can identify ARGs from non-culturable bacteria with a potentially low identity shared with known ARGs. In 2016, the ResFinderFG v1.0 database was created to collect ARGs from functional metagenomics studies. Here, we present the second version of the database, ResFinderFG v2.0, which is available on the Center of Genomic Epidemiology web server (https://cge.food.dtu.dk/services/ResFinderFG/).

The information page of each record gives the structures and properties of the prodrug and the active drug side by side which makes it easy for the user to instantly compare them. The structural modifications in the prodrug/active drugs are highlighted in a different colour for easy comparison. Experimental data has been curated from the downloaded PubMed and patent articles and were catalogued in a tabular form with more than 25 fields under sub-sections i) name and structures of the prodrugs and their active compounds, ii) mode of activation of the prodrug and enzyme/biocatalyst involved in the conversion, iii) indications/disease, iv) pharmacological target, v) experimental pharmacokinetic properties such as solubility, absorption, volume of distribution, half-life, clearance etc. and vi) information on the purpose/gain from the prodrug strategies.

"36420165","RNAME: A comprehensive database of RNA modification enzymes. The dynamic RNA modifications were orchestrated by a series of enzymes, namely ""writer"", ""reader"" and ""eraser"", which can install, recognize and remove the modifications, respectively. However, only a very small number of experimentally validated RNA modification enzymes have been identified and reported. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a database to deposit RNA modification enzymes. In the present work, we developed the RNAME database (https://chenweilab.cn/rname/) to provide a comprehensive resource for RNA modification enzymes. The current version of RNAME deposits more than 21,000 manually curated RNA modification enzymes, which are from 456 species and covers the 7 common kinds of RNA modifications (i.e., adenosine to inosine, N1-methyladenosine, N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytidine, N7-methylguanosine, mRNA cap modification, and pseudouridine). The 3D structures, domains, subcellular locations, and biological functions of these enzymes were also integrated in RNAME. It is anticipated that RNAME will facilitate the researches on RNA modifications.","11/11/2022","http://chenweilab.cn/rname","RNAME",0.991551518440247,"",0,"RNAME",0.991551518,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

To meet the critical demand of LTR-RTs data-driven research, we updated the CicerSpTEdb database to version 2.0, which includes more accurate intact LTR-RT elements with annotation of internal domains. We also added the ability to BLAST against TEs of Cicer species. As a result, 3701 intact LTR-RTs were detected in the studied genomes, including 2840 Copia and 861 Gypsy elements. Of the 3701 intact LTR-RTs, 588 were in C. arietinum, including 475 Copia and 113 Gypsy. While 1373 were detected in C. reticulatum, including 1041 Copia and 332 Gypsy. Furthermore, 1740 were found in C. echinospermum, including 1324 Copia and 416 Gypsy. Based on LTR-RT clades, the analysis classified the 3701 identified intact LTR-RTs in the studied genomes as Ale (850), SIRE (740), unknown (455), Ikeros (323), Reina (290), Tork (290), Ivana (282), Tekay (197), Athila (128), TAR (99), CRM (31), and Ogre (16) elements.

"37572440","VirhostlncR: A comprehensive database to explore lncRNAs and their targets in viral infections. Long non-coding-RNAs (lncRNAs) are an expanding set of cis-/trans-regulatory RNA genes that outnumber the protein-coding genes. Although being increasingly discovered, the functional role of the majority of lncRNAs in diverse biological conditions is undefined. Increasing evidence supports the critical role of lncRNAs in the emergence, regulation, and progression of various viral infections including influenza, hepatitis, coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Hence, the identification of signature lncRNAs would facilitate focused analysis of their functional roles accounting for their targets and regulatory mechanisms associated with infections. Towards this, we compiled 2803 lncRNAs identified to be modulated by 33 viral strains in various mammalian cell types and are provided through the resource named VirhostlncR (http://ciods.in/VirhostlncR/). The information on each of the viral strains, their multiplicity of infection, duration of infection, host cell name and cell types, fold change of lncRNA expression, and their specific identification methods are integrated into VirhostlncR. Based on the current datasets, we report 150 lncRNAs including differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA (DANCR), metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), and plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) to be perturbed by two or more viruses. Analysis of viral protein interactions with human transcription factors (TFs) or TF-containing protein complexes identified that distinct viruses can transcriptionally regulate many of these lncRNAs through multiple protein complexes. Together, we believe that the current dataset will enable priority selection of lncRNAs for identification of their targets and serve as an effective platform for the analysis of noncoding RNA-mediated regulations in viral infections.","7/17/2023","http://ciods.in/VirhostlncR","VirhostlncR",0.984462916851044,"",0,"VirhostlncR",0.984462917,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"35899212, 35755024","Development and Implementation of the AIDA International Registry for Patients With VEXAS Syndrome. Objective The aim of this paper is to present the AutoInflammatory Disease Alliance (AIDA) international Registry dedicated to Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, Autoinflammatory, Somatic (VEXAS) syndrome, describing its design, construction, and modalities of dissemination. Methods This Registry is a clinical, physician-driven, population- and electronic-based instrument designed for the retrospective and prospective collection of real-life data. Data gathering is based on the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tool and is intended to obtain real-world evidence for daily patients' management. The Registry may potentially communicate with other on-line tools dedicated to VEXAS syndrome, thus enhancing international collaboration and data sharing for research purposes. The Registry is practical enough to be easily modified to meet future needs regarding VEXAS syndrome. Results To date (April 22nd, 2022), 113 Centers from 23 Countries in 4 continents have been involved; 324 users (114 Principal Investigators, 205 Site Investigators, 2 Lead Investigators, and 3 data managers) are currently able to access the registry for data entry (or data sharing) and collection. The Registry includes 4,952 fields organized into 18 instruments designed to fully describe patient's details about demographics, clinical manifestations, symptoms, histologic details about skin and bone marrow biopsies and aspirate, laboratory features, complications, comorbidities, therapies, and healthcare access. Conclusion This international Registry for patients with VEXAS syndrome will allow the achievement of a comprehensive knowledge about this new disease, with the final goal to obtain real-world evidence for daily clinical practice, especially in relation to the comprehension of this disease about the natural history and the possible therapeutic approaches.

"35306140","LTM-TCM: A comprehensive database for the linking of Traditional Chinese Medicine with modern medicine at molecular and phenotypic levels. Benefiting from the development of network pharmacology, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) shows great potential in modern drug discovery. Recently, more and more TCM-related databases have been established for both academic and industry research, but they are still insufficient in data standardization, integrity, and precision. To better accelerate the TCM research and overcome these shortcomings, we construct a web-based TCM platform, LTM-TCM, which is currently the most comprehensive TCM database that includes the following advantages: (1) High-quality data integration from fourteen TCM authoritative databases, especially with additional manual collected 41,025 clinical treatment records and 213 ancient Chinese medical books. (2) Accurate correction of multi-source TCM interactions (between symptoms, prescriptions, herbs, ingredients and targets) through in-house Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) approaches in more than 30 million articles. (3) Diverse cross-field pipelines (e.g., bioactive ingredients screening, targets prediction, and mechanism prediction, etc.) help integrating traditional medicine with modern science in common aspects at both the molecular and phenotypic levels. In summary, LTM-TCM contains 1928 symptoms, 48,126 prescriptions, 9122 plants, 34,967 ingredients, 13,109 targets and 1170,133 interactions among all TCM related components.

"36162821","CohesinDB: a comprehensive database for decoding cohesin-related epigenomes, 3D genomes and transcriptomes in human cells. Cohesin is a multifunctional protein responsible for transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. Cohesin binds to chromatin at tens of thousands of distinct sites in a conserved or tissue-specific manner, whereas the function of cohesin varies greatly depending on the epigenetic properties of specific chromatin loci. Cohesin also extensively mediates cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and chromatin loops. Even though next-generation sequencing technologies have provided a wealth of information on different aspects of cohesin, the integration and exploration of the resultant massive cohesin datasets are not straightforward. Here, we present CohesinDB (https://cohesindb.iqb.u-tokyo.ac.jp), a comprehensive multiomics cohesin database in human cells. CohesinDB includes 2043 epigenomics, transcriptomics and 3D genomics datasets from 530 studies involving 176 cell types. By integrating these large-scale data, CohesinDB summarizes three types of 'cohesin objects': 751 590 cohesin binding sites, 957 868 cohesin-related chromatin loops and 2√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†229 500 cohesin-related CRMs. Each cohesin object is annotated with locus, cell type, classification, function, 3D genomics and cis-regulatory information.

This apparently simple structural motif can generate many architectures and topologies. Coiled coil-forming sequences can be predicted from heptad repeats of hydrophobic and polar residues, hpphppp, although this is not always reliable. Alternatively, coiled-coil structures can be identified using the program SOCKET, which finds knobs-into-holes (KIH) packing between side chains of neighboring helices. SOCKET also classifies coiled-coil architecture and topology, thus allowing sequence-to-structure relationships to be garnered. In 2009, we used SOCKET to create a relational database of coiled-coil structures, CC+ , from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here, we report an update of CC+ following an update of SOCKET (to Socket2) and the recent explosion of structural data and the success of AlphaFold2 in predicting protein structures from genome sequences. With the most-stringent SOCKET parameters, CC+ contains √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬à12,000 coiled-coil assemblies from experimentally determined structures, and √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬à120,000 potential coiled-coil structures within single-chain models predicted by AlphaFold2 across 48 proteomes.

CC+ is available freely at http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/CCPlus/Home.html. It will be updated automatically.

"37861121","ColabFit exchange: Open-access datasets for data-driven interatomic potentials. Data-driven interatomic potentials (IPs) trained on large collections of first principles calculations are rapidly becoming essential tools in the fields of computational materials science and chemistry for performing atomic-scale simulations. Despite this, apart from a few notable exceptions, there is a distinct lack of well-organized, public datasets in common formats available for use with IP development. This deficiency precludes the research community from implementing widespread benchmarking, which is essential for gaining insight into model performance and transferability, and also limits the development of more general, or even universal, IPs. To address this issue, we introduce the ColabFit Exchange, the first database providing open access to a large collection of systematically organized datasets from multiple domains that is especially designed for IP development. The ColabFit Exchange is publicly available at https://colabfit.org, providing a web-based interface for exploring, downloading, and contributing datasets.

One powerful strategy of how to increase the complexity of cellular proteomes is through posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins.

Although mitochondrial proteins undergoing PTMs were identified nearly 6 decades ago, studies on the roles and extent of PTMs on mitochondrial functions lagged behind the other cellular compartments. The application of mass spectrometry for the characterization of the mitochondrial proteome as well as for the detection of various PTMs resulted in the identification of thousands of amino acid positions that can be modified by different chemical groups. However, the data on mitochondrial PTMs are scattered in several data sets, and the available databases do not contain a complete list of modified residues. To integrate information on PTMs of the mitochondrial proteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we built the yeast mitochondrial posttranslational modification (y-mtPTM) database (http://compbio.fmph.uniba.sk/y-mtptm/). It lists nearly 20,000 positions on mitochondrial proteins affected by √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬à√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬º20 various PTMs, with phosphorylated, succinylated, acetylated, and ubiquitylated sites being the most abundant.

Each 'medicinal plant-disease cured' relation is scored based on the availability of any medicine/product derived from that medicinal plant, information about active compound(s), knowledge regarding the part of plant that is effective and number of distinct articles/books/websites confirming the effectiveness of the medicinal plant. The user can find the best plant(s) that can be used to cure any desired disease(s). The DISPEL database is the first step towards generating the 'most-effective' combination of plants to cure a disease since it delineates as well as ranks all the therapeutic medicinal plants for that disease. The combination of best medicinal plants can then be used to conduct clinical trials and thus pave the way for their use in clinics for treatment of diseases.

"35435220","An atlas of human viruses provides new insights into diversity and tissue tropism of human viruses. Motivation Viruses continue to threaten human health. Yet, the complete viral species carried by humans and their infection characteristics have not been fully revealed. Results This study curated an atlas of human viruses from public databases and literature, and built the Human Virus Database (HVD). The HVD contains 1131 virus species of 54 viral families which were more than twice the number of the human-infecting virus species reported in previous studies. These viruses were identified in human samples including 68 human tissues, the excreta and body fluid. The viral diversity in humans was age-dependent with a peak in the infant and a valley in the teenager. The tissue tropism of viruses was found to be associated with several factors including the viral group (DNA, RNA or reverse-transcribing viruses), enveloped or not, viral genome length and GC content, viral receptors and the virus-interacting proteins. Finally, the tissue tropism of DNA viruses was predicted using a random-forest algorithm with a middle performance. Overall, the study not only provides a valuable resource for further studies of human viruses but also deepens our understanding toward the diversity and tissue tropism of human viruses. Availability and implementation The HVD is available at http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/.

"36917599","AFTM: a database of transmembrane regions in the human proteome predicted by AlphaFold. Transmembrane proteins (TMPs), with diverse cellular functions, are difficult targets for structural determination. Predictions of TMPs and the locations of transmembrane segments using computational methods could be unreliable due to the potential for false positives and false negatives and show inconsistencies across different programs. Recent advances in protein structure prediction methods have made it possible to identify TMPs and their membrane-spanning regions using high-quality structural models. We developed the AlphaFold Transmembrane proteins (AFTM) database of candidate human TMPs by identifying transmembrane regions in AlphaFold structural models of human proteins and their domains using the positioning of proteins in membranes, version 3 program, followed by automatic corrections inspired by manual analysis of the results. We compared our results to annotations from the UniProt database and the Human Transmembrane Proteome (HTP) database. While AFTM did not identify transmembrane regions in some single-pass TMPs, it identified more transmembrane regions for multipass TMPs than UniProt and HTP. AFTM also showed more consistent results with experimental structures, as benchmarked against the Protein Data Bank Transmembrane proteins (PDBTM) database. In addition, some proteins previously annotated as TMPs were suggested to be non-TMPs by AFTM. We report the results of AFTM together with those of UniProt, HTP, TmAlphaFold, PDBTM and Membranome in the online AFTM database compiled as a comprehensive resource of candidate human TMPs with structural models.

"35356542","KDmarkers: A biomarker database for investigating epigenetic methylation and gene expression levels in Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease (KD) is a form of acute systemic vasculitis that primarily affects children and has become the most common cause of acquired heart disease. While the etiopathogenesis of KD remains unknown, the diagnostic criteria of KD have been well established. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of KD is currently based on subjective clinical symptoms, and no molecular biomarker is yet available. We have previously performed and combined methylation array (Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) and transcriptome array (Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0) to identify genes that are differentially methylated/expressed in KD patients compared with control subjects. We have found that decreased methylation levels combined with elevated gene expression can indicate genes (e.g., toll-like receptors and CD177) involved in the disease mechanisms of KD. In this study, we constructed a database called KDmarkers to allow researchers to access these valuable potential KD biomarkers identified via methylation array and transcriptome array. KDmarkers provides three search modes. First, users can search genes differentially methylated and/or differentially expressed in KD patients compared with control subjects. Second, users can check the KD patient groups in which a given gene is differentially methylated and/or differentially expressed. Third, users can explore the DNA methylation levels and gene expression levels in all samples (KD patients and controls) for a particular gene of interest. We further demonstrated that the results in KDmarkers are strongly associated with KD immune responses. All analysis results can be downloaded for downstream experimental designs.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has seen multiple anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies being generated globally. It is difficult, however, to assemble a useful compendium of these biological properties if they are derived from experimental measurements performed at different sites under different experimental conditions. The Coronavirus Immunotherapeutic Consortium (COVIC) circumvents these issues by experimentally testing blinded antibodies side by side for several functional activities. To collect these data in a consistent fashion and make it publicly available, we established the COVIC database (COVIC-DB, https://covicdb.lji.org/). This database enables systematic analysis and interpretation of this large-scale dataset by providing a comprehensive view of various features such as affinity, neutralization, in vivo protection and effector functions for each antibody. Interactive graphs enable direct comparisons of antibodies based on select functional properties.

"36006844","CPMCP: a database of Chinese patent medicine and compound prescription. Although several traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-related databases have emerged, they focus on researching single medicinal materials, which is far from sufficient for clinical research and application. In comparison, compound prescriptions are more informative and meaningful in TCM, for they embody the information on the compatibility of TCM besides the relatively isolated information about single medicinal materials. The compatibility information is essential in TCM because it conveys not only what components are involved to treat special diseases but also how to combine these single medical materials. We established a database of Chinese patent medicine and compound prescription (CPMCP). It demonstrates the prescription information of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) and ancient Chinese medicine prescriptions (CMPs). CPMCP reports their comprehensive and standardized information such as the components, indications and contraindications. It is worth mentioning that we organized relevant experts and spent lots of time manually mapping the functions of compound prescriptions in ancient Chinese to the standardized TCM symptom vocabularies, obtaining a total of 71√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â414 associations between compound prescriptions and TCM symptoms.

"36318256","CRdb: a comprehensive resource for deciphering chromatin regulators in human. Chromatin regulators (CRs) regulate epigenetic patterns on a partial or global scale, playing a critical role in affecting multi-target gene expression. As chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data associated with CRs are rapidly accumulating, a comprehensive resource of CRs needs to be built urgently for collecting, integrating, and processing these data, which can provide abundant annotated information on CR upstream and downstream regulatory analyses as well as CR-related analysis functions. This study established an integrative CR resource, named CRdb (http://cr.liclab.net/crdb/), with the aim of curating a large number of available resources for CRs and providing extensive annotations and analyses of CRs to help biological researchers clarify the regulation mechanism and function of CRs. The CRdb database comprised a total of 647 CRs and 2,591 ChIP-seq samples from more than 300 human tissues and cell types. These samples have been manually curated from NCBI GEO/SRA and ENCODE. Importantly, CRdb provided the abundant and detailed genetic annotations in CR-binding regions based on ChIP-seq. Furthermore, CRdb supported various functional annotations and upstream regulatory information on CRs. In particular, it embedded four types of CR regulatory analyses: CR gene set enrichment, CR-binding genomic region annotation, CR-TF co-occupancy analysis, and CR regulatory axis analysis. CRdb is a useful and powerful resource that can help in exploring the potential functions of CRs and their regulatory mechanism in diseases and biological processes.","1/1/2023","http://cr.liclab.net/crdb","CRdb",0.995674848556519,"",0,"CRdb",0.995674849,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"37181287","CRAC (Clinical Relevance of Alterations in Cancer): a Knowledge Base for the Selection of Molecularly Matched Therapy for Solid Tumors. Multigene testing using NGS (next-generation sequencing) provides a large amount of information and can detect multiple molecular alterations. Subsequent clinical interpretation is a time-consuming process necessary to select a treatment strategy. Existing databases often contain inconsistent information and are not regularly updated. The use of ESCAT levels of evidence requires a deep understanding of the nature of alterations and does not answer the question of which therapy option to select when multiple biomarkers with the same level of evidence are detected. To address these issues, we created the Clinical Relevance of Alterations in Cancer (CRAC) database on the relevance of detected alterations in specific genes, which are often analyzed as part of NGS panels. The team of oncologists and biologists assigned a CRAC score from 1 to 10 to each biomarker (a type of genomic alteration characteristic of specific genes) for 15 malignancies; an average score was entered into the database. CRAC scores are a numerical reflection of the following factors: therapy availability and the prospects of drug treatment with experimental drugs for patients with a particular type of tumor. A total of 134 genes and 15 of the most common tumor types have been selected for CRAC. The biomarker-nosology associations with CRAC scores in the range of 1-3 are the most frequent (n=2719 out of 3495; 77.8%), the least frequent ones (n=52 out of 3495; 1.5%) are with the highest CRAC scores 9 and 10. To estimate the practical effectiveness of the CRAC database, 208 reports on comprehensive molecular profiling were retrospectively analyzed; the applicability of CRAC was compared with the ESCAT level of evidence system. The highest CRAC scores corresponded to the ESCAT maximum levels of evidence: the range of scores 8-10 corresponded to evidence levels I and II. No biomarker within the same level of evidence was represented by the same CRAC score; the largest range of CRAC scores was observed for biomarkers of levels evidence IIIA and IV - from 2 to 10 and from 1 to 9, respectively. The use of CRAC scores allowed to identify additional 95 alterations with CRAC scores of 1-5 in the studied patients.

"37291365","Hmrbase2: a comprehensive database of hormones and their receptors. Purpose Hormones play a critical role in regulating various physiological processes and any hormonal imbalances can lead to major endocrine disorders. Thus, studying hormones is essential for both the therapeutics and the diagnostics of hormonal diseases. To facilitate this need, we have developed Hmrbase2, a comprehensive platform that provides extensive information on hormones. Methods Hmrbase2 is a web-based database which is an update of a previously published database, Hmrbase ( http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/hmrbase/ ). We collected a large amount of information on peptide and non-peptide hormones and hormone receptors, this information being sourced from Hmrbase, HMDB, UniProt, HORDB, ENDONET, PubChem, and the medical literature. Results Hmrbase2 contains a total of 12,056 entries, which is more than twice the number of entries contained in the previous version Hmrbase. These include 7406, 753, and 3897 entries for peptide hormones, non-peptide hormones, and hormone receptors, respectively, from 803 organisms compared to the 562 organisms in the previous version. The database also hosts 5662 hormone receptor pairs. The source organism, function, and subcellular location are provided for peptide hormones and receptors and properties such as melting point and water solubility is provided for non-peptide hormones. Besides browsing and keyword search, an advanced search option has also been supplied. Additionally, a similarity search module has been incorporated enabling users to run similarity searches against peptide hormone sequences using BLAST and Smith-Waterman. Conclusions To make the database accessible to various users, we designed a user-friendly, responsive website that can be easily used on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

"36259664","CREAMMIST: an integrative probabilistic database for cancer drug response prediction. Extensive in vitro cancer drug screening datasets have enabled scientists to identify biomarkers and develop machine learning models for predicting drug sensitivity. While most advancements have focused on omics profiles, cancer drug sensitivity scores precalculated by the original sources are often used as-is, without consideration for variabilities between studies. It is well-known that significant inconsistencies exist between the drug sensitivity scores across datasets due to differences in experimental setups and preprocessing methods used to obtain the sensitivity scores. As a result, many studies opt to focus only on a single dataset, leading to underutilization of available data and a limited interpretation of cancer pharmacogenomics analysis. To overcome these caveats, we have developed CREAMMIST (https://creammist.mtms.dev), an integrative database that enables users to obtain an integrative dose-response curve, to capture uncertainty (or high certainty when multiple datasets well align) across five widely used cancer cell-line drug-response datasets. We utilized the Bayesian framework to systematically integrate all available dose-response values across datasets (>14 millions dose-response data points). CREAMMIST provides easy-to-use statistics derived from the integrative dose-response curves for various downstream analyses such as identifying biomarkers, selecting drug concentrations for experiments, and training robust machine learning models.","1/1/2023","http://creammist.mtms.dev","CREAMMIST",0.986540794372559,"",0,"CREAMMIST",0.986540794,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"35891797","CRISPR-surfaceome: An online tool for designing highly efficient sgRNAs targeting cell surface proteins. CRISPR-based genome-editing tools have emerged as an efficient tool for functional genomics studies. Online tools and databases have been developed to facilitate the design and selection of CRISPR single guide RNA (sgRNA) for gene modifications. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these tools or database are designated to cell surface proteins. In a previous study, we described the development and application of surfaceome CRISPR libraries targeting to cell surface proteins on human cells. Here, we present the design and construction of an online tool and database (https://crispr-surfaceome.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/home), named CRISPR-Surfaceome, for the design of highly efficient sgRNA targeting to the surface proteins on human cells. To show case and validate the efficiencies of sgRNAs designed by this online tool, we chose ICAM-1 gene for knockout studies and found that all the 10 designed ICAM-1 sgRNAs could efficiently generate knockout cells, with more than 80% gene disruption rates. These ICAM-1 knockout cells were found to be resistant to the infection of rhinovirus (RV), which utilizes ICAM-1 as the receptor. Therefore, CRISPR-Surfaceome can serve the research community for the functional genomics studies on cell surface proteins, such as identification of pathogen receptors and discovery of drug targets.","7/18/2022","http://crispr-surfaceome.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/home","CRISPR-Surfaceome",0.986585148743221,"",0,"CRISPR-Surfaceome",0.986585149,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36031487","Taiwan Controlled Substances Database. New psychoactive substances (NPS) have increasingly been illegally synthesized and used around the world in recent years. Due to the large volume and the variety of NPS, most do not have sufficient information about their addictive potential and harmful effects to human subjects. This makes it difficult to evaluate these potential substances of abuse. This study aims to build a database based on Taiwan's controlled substances, to provide quick structural and pharmacological feedback. Taiwan Controlled Substances Database (TCSD) includes the collection of controlled substances, relevant experimental and structural information, as well as computational features such as molecular fingerprints and descriptors. Two types of structural search were added: substructure search and topological fingerprint similarity search. A web framework was used to enhance accessibility and usability (https://cs2search.cmdm.tw).","8/26/2022","http://cs2search.cmdm.tw","TCSD",0.986133396625519,"Taiwan Controlled Substances Database",0.989185810089111,"Taiwan Controlled Substances Database",0.98918581,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

The Carbohydrate Structure Database (CSDB, http://csdb.glycoscience.ru/ ) is a free curated repository storing various data on glycans of bacterial, fungal and plant origins. Currently, it maintains a close-to-full coverage on bacterial and fungal carbohydrates up to the year 2020. The CSDB web-interface provides free access to the database content and dedicated tools. Still, the number of these tools and the types of the corresponding analyses is limited, whereas the database itself contains data that can be used in a broader scope of analytical studies. In this paper, we present CSDB source data files and a self-contained SQL dump, and exemplify their possible application in glycan-related studies. By using CSDB in an SQL format, the user can gain access to the chain length distribution or charge distribution (as an example) in a given set of glycans defined according to specific structural, taxonomic, or other parameters, whereas the source text dump files can be imported to any dedicated database with a specific internal architecture differing from that of CSDB.","3/30/2022","http://csdb.glycoscience.ru","CSDB",0.980909228,"Carbohydrate Structure Database",0.95511257648468,"CSDB",0.980909228,2,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36894999","A crowdsourcing database for the copy-number variation of the Spanish population. Background Despite being a very common type of genetic variation, the distribution of copy-number variations (CNVs) in the population is still poorly understood. The knowledge of the genetic variability, especially at the level of the local population, is a critical factor for distinguishing pathogenic from non-pathogenic variation in the discovery of new disease variants. Results Here, we present the SPAnish Copy Number Alterations Collaborative Server (SPACNACS), which currently contains copy number variation profiles obtained from more than 400 genomes and exomes of unrelated Spanish individuals. By means of a collaborative crowdsourcing effort whole genome and whole exome sequencing data, produced by local genomic projects and for other purposes, is continuously collected. Once checked both, the Spanish ancestry and the lack of kinship with other individuals in the SPACNACS, the CNVs are inferred for these sequences and they are used to populate the database. A web interface allows querying the database with different filters that include ICD10 upper categories. This allows discarding samples from the disease under study and obtaining pseudo-control CNV profiles from the local population. We also show here additional studies on the local impact of CNVs in some phenotypes and on pharmacogenomic variants. SPACNACS can be accessed at: http://csvs.clinbioinfosspa.es/spacnacs/ . Conclusion SPACNACS facilitates disease gene discovery by providing detailed information of the local variability of the population and exemplifies how to reuse genomic data produced for other purposes to build a local reference database.","3/9/2023","http://csvs.clinbioinfosspa.es/spacnacs","SPACNACS",0.996763706207275,"SPAnish Copy Number Alterations Collaborative Server",0.867113304138184,"SPACNACS",0.996763706,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"34570230","CTR-DB, an omnibus for patient-derived gene expression signatures correlated with cancer drug response. To date, only some cancer patients can benefit from chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Drug resistance continues to be a major and challenging problem facing current cancer research. Rapidly accumulated patient-derived clinical transcriptomic data with cancer drug response bring opportunities for exploring molecular determinants of drug response, but meanwhile pose challenges for data management, integration, and reuse. Here we present the Cancer Treatment Response gene signature DataBase (CTR-DB, http://ctrdb.ncpsb.org.cn/), a unique database for basic and clinical researchers to access, integrate, and reuse clinical transcriptomes with cancer drug response. CTR-DB has collected and uniformly reprocessed 83 patient-derived pre-treatment transcriptomic source datasets with manually curated cancer drug response information, involving 28 histological cancer types, 123 drugs, and 5139 patient samples. These data are browsable, searchable, and downloadable. Moreover, CTR-DB supports single-dataset exploration (including differential gene expression, receiver operating characteristic curve, functional enrichment, sensitizing drug search, and tumor microenvironment analyses), and multiple-dataset combination and comparison, as well as biomarker validation function, which provide insights into the drug resistance mechanism, predictive biomarker discovery and validation, drug combination, and resistance mechanism heterogeneity.","1/1/2022","http://ctrdb.ncpsb.org.cn","CTR-DB",0.997690117359161,"Cancer Treatment Response gene signature DataBase",0.989051478249686,"CTR-DB",0.997690117,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"36265769","CTRR-ncRNA: A Knowledgebase for Cancer Therapy Resistance and Recurrence Associated Non-coding RNAs. Cancer therapy resistance and recurrence (CTRR) are the dominant causes of death in cancer patients. Recent studies have indicated that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can not only reverse the resistance to cancer therapy but also are crucial biomarkers for the evaluation and prediction of CTRR. Herein, we developed CTRR-ncRNA, a knowledgebase of CTRR-associated ncRNAs, aiming to provide an accurate and comprehensive resource for research involving the association between CTRR and ncRNAs. Compared to most of the existing cancer databases, CTRR-ncRNA is focused on the clinical characterization of cancers, including cancer subtypes, as well as survival outcomes and responses to personalized therapy of cancer patients. Information pertaining to biomarker ncRNAs has also been documented for the development of personalized CTRR prediction. A user-friendly interface and several functional modules have been incorporated into the database. Based on the preliminary analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships, universal ncRNAs have been found to be potential biomarkers for CTRR. The CTRR-ncRNA is a translation-oriented knowledgebase and it provides a valuable resource for mechanistic investigations and explainable artificial intelligence-based modeling.

"36698975","CUCUME: An RNA methylation database integrating systemic mRNAs signals, GWAS and QTL genetic regulation and epigenetics in different tissues of Cucurbitaceae. As an internal modification of transcripts, RNA methylation determines RNA fate by changing RNA-protein binding affinity. In plants, RNA methylation is ubiquitous and is involved in all aspects of RNA post-transcriptional regulation. For instance, long-distance mobile RNAs, strongly influenced by their methylation status, play important roles in plant growth, development and environmental adaptation. Cucumber/pumpkin heterografts are widely used to improve stress tolerance of cucumber and to study mobile RNA signals due to their strong developed vasculature system. Here, we developed the Cucume (Cucurbit RNA methylation, http://cucume.cn/) database for these two important vegetables, cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) with high productivity worldwide. We identified mRNAs harboring 5-methylcytosine (m5C) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) sites in pumpkin and cucumber at the whole genome level via Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) of different tissues and the vascular exudates. In addition to RNA methylation sites, the Cucume database includes graft-transmissible systemic mRNAs identified in previous studies using cucumber/pumpkin heterografts. The further integration of cucumber genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) allows the study of RNA methylation-related genetic and epigenetic regulation in cucurbits. Therefore, the here developed Cucume database will promote understanding the role of cucurbit RNA methylation in RNA mobility and QTL, ultimately benefitting future breeding of agronomic crop germplasms.","1/10/2023","http://cucume.cn","Cucume",0.973011016845703,"Cucurbit RNA methylation",0.649693042039871,"Cucume",0.973011017,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"36271794","CuGenDBv2: an updated database for cucurbit genomics. The Cucurbitaceae (cucurbit) family consists of about 1,000 species in 95 genera, including many economically important and popular fruit and vegetable crops. During the past several years, reference genomes have been generated for >20 cucurbit species, and variome and transcriptome profiling data have been rapidly accumulated for cucurbits. To efficiently mine, analyze and disseminate these large-scale datasets, we have developed an updated version of Cucurbit Genomics Database. The updated database, CuGenDBv2 (http://cucurbitgenomics.org/v2), currently hosts 34 reference genomes from 27 cucurbit species/subspecies belonging to 10 different genera. Protein-coding genes from these genomes have been comprehensively annotated by comparing their protein sequences to various public protein and domain databases. A novel 'Genotype' module has been implemented to facilitate mining and analysis of the functionally annotated variome data including SNPs and small indels from large-scale genome sequencing projects. An updated 'Expression' module has been developed to provide a comprehensive gene expression atlas for cucurbits. Furthermore, synteny blocks between any two and within each of the 34 genomes, representing a total of 595 pair-wise genome comparisons, have been identified and can be explored and visualized in the database.","1/1/2023","http://cucurbitgenomics.org/v2","CuGenDBv2",0.982203125953674,"Cucurbit Genomics Database",0.556081048079899,"CuGenDBv2",0.982203126,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Membrane permeability is an essential indicator of oral bioavailability and intracellular targeting, and the development of membrane-permeable peptides is a bottleneck in cyclic peptide drug discovery. Although many experimental data on membrane permeability of cyclic peptides have been reported, a comprehensive database is not yet available. A comprehensive membrane permeability database is essential for developing computational methods for cyclic peptide drug design. In this study, we constructed CycPeptMPDB, the first web-accessible database of cyclic peptide membrane permeability. We collected information on a total of 7334 cyclic peptides, including the structure and experimentally measured membrane permeability, from 45 published papers and 2 patents from pharmaceutical companies. To unambiguously represent cyclic peptides larger than small molecules, we used the hierarchical editing language for macromolecules notation to generate a uniform sequence representation of peptides. In addition to data storage, CycPeptMPDB provides several supporting functions such as online data visualization, data analysis, and downloading. CycPeptMPDB is expected to be a valuable platform to support membrane permeability research on cyclic peptides.

"36305460","CysModDB: a comprehensive platform with the integration of manually curated resources and analysis tools for cysteine posttranslational modifications. The unique chemical reactivity of cysteine residues results in various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), which are implicated in regulating a range of fundamental biological processes. With the advent of chemical proteomics technology, thousands of cysteine PTM (CysPTM) sites have been identified from multiple species. A few CysPTM-based databases have been developed, but they mainly focus on data collection rather than various annotations and analytical integration. Here, we present a platform-dubbed CysModDB, integrated with the comprehensive CysPTM resources and analysis tools. CysModDB contains five parts: (1) 70√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†536 experimentally verified CysPTM sites with annotations of sample origin and enrichment techniques, (2) 21√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†654 modified proteins annotated with functional regions and structure information, (3) cross-references to external databases such as the protein-protein interactions database, (4) online computational tools for predicting CysPTM sites and (5) integrated analysis tools such as gene enrichment and investigation of sequence features. These parts are integrated using a customized graphic browser and a Basket. The browser uses graphs to represent the distribution of modified sites with different CysPTM types on protein sequences and mapping these sites to the protein structures and functional regions, which assists in exploring cross-talks between the modified sites and their potential effect on protein functions. The Basket connects proteins and CysPTM sites to the analysis tools.

Zebrafish, a popular organism for studying embryonic development and for modeling human diseases, has so far lacked a systematic functional annotation program akin to those in other animal models. To address this, we formed the international DANIO-CODE consortium and created a central repository to store and process zebrafish developmental functional genomic data. Our data coordination center ( https://danio-code.zfin.org ) combines a total of 1,802 sets of unpublished and re-analyzed published genomic data, which we used to improve existing annotations and show its utility in experimental design. We identified over 140,000 cis-regulatory elements throughout development, including classes with distinct features dependent on their activity in time and space. We delineated the distinct distance topology and chromatin features between regulatory elements active during zygotic genome activation and those active during organogenesis. Finally, we matched regulatory elements and epigenomic landscapes between zebrafish and mouse and predicted functional relationships between them beyond sequence similarity, thus extending the utility of zebrafish developmental genomics to mammals.","7/4/2022","http://danio-code.zfin.org","DANIO-CODE",0.899943471,"",0,"DANIO-CODE",0.899943471,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"36999559","A review of the International Seabed Authority database DeepData from a biological perspective: challenges and opportunities in the UN Ocean Decade. There is an urgent need for high-quality biodiversity data in the context of rapid environmental change. Nowhere is this need more urgent than in the deep ocean, with the possibility of seabed mining moving from exploration to exploitation, but where vast knowledge gaps persist. Regions of the seabed beyond national jurisdiction, managed by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), are undergoing intensive mining exploration, including the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Central Pacific. In 2019, the ISA launched its database 'DeepData', publishing environmental (including biological) data. Here, we explore how DeepData could support biological research and environmental policy development in the CCZ (and wider ocean regions) and whether data are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Given the direct connection of DeepData with the regulator of a rapidly developing potential industry, this review is particularly timely. We found evidence of extensive duplication of datasets; an absence of unique record identifiers and significant taxonomic data-quality issues, compromising FAIRness of the data. The publication of DeepData records on the OBIS ISA node in 2021 has led to large-scale improvements in data quality and accessibility. However, limitations in the usage of identifiers and issues with taxonomic information were also evident in datasets published on the node, stemming from mismapping of data from the ISA environmental data template to the data standard Darwin Core prior to data harvesting by OBIS. While notable data-quality issues remain, these changes signal a rapid evolution for the database and significant movement towards integrating with global systems, through the usage of data standards and publication on the global data aggregator OBIS. This is exactly what has been needed for biological datasets held by the ISA. We provide recommendations for the future development of the database to support this evolution towards FAIR.

The current project aimed to provide a detailed repository for the anatomical and physiological parameters of porcine skin, with the aim of parametrizing the Multi-phase Multi-layer Mechanistic Dermal Absorption (MPML MechDermA) Model in the Simcyp Simulator. The MPML MechDermA Model is a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that accounts for the physiology and geometry of skin in a mechanistic mathematical modelling framework.

"37114805","MBS: a genome browser annotation track for high-confident microRNA binding sites in whole human transcriptome. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that play a role in many regulatory pathways in eukaryotes. They usually exert their functions by binding mature messenger RNAs. The prediction of the binding targets of the endogenous miRNAs is crucial to unravel the processes they are involved in. In this work, we performed an extensive miRNA binding sites (MBS) prediction over all the annotated transcript sequences and made them available through an UCSC track. MBS annotation track allows to study and visualize the human miRNA binding sites transcriptome-wide in a genome browser, together with any other available information the user is interested in. In the creation of the database that underlies the MBS track, three consolidated algorithms of miRNA binding prediction have been used: PITA, miRanda and TargetScan, and information about the binding sites predicted by all of them has been collected. MBS track displays high-confident miRNA binding sites for the whole length of each human transcript, both coding and non-coding ones. Each annotation can redirect to a web page with the details of the miRNA binding and the involved transcripts. MBS can be easily applied to retrieve specific information such as the effects of alternative splicing on miRNA binding or when a specific miRNA binds an exon-exon junction in the mature RNA. Overall, MBS will be of great help for studying and visualizing, in a user-friendly mode, the predicted miRNA binding sites on all the transcripts arising from a gene or a region of interest.

The rapid advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has paved the way for studying the expression of viral receptors in different tissues of animal species at single-cell resolution, resulting in huge scRNA-seq datasets. However, effectively integrating or sharing these datasets among the research community is challenging, especially for laboratory scientists. In this study, we manually curated up-to-date datasets generated in animal scRNA-seq studies, analyzed them using a unified processing pipeline, and comprehensively annotated 107 viral receptors in 142 viruses and obtained accurate expression signatures in 2 100 962 cells from 47 animal species. Thus, the VThunter database provides a user-friendly interface for the research community to explore the expression signatures of viral receptors. VThunter offers an informative and convenient resource for scientists to better understand the interactions between viral receptors and animal viruses and to assess viral pathogenesis and transmission in species.

"35779245","dbBIP: a comprehensive bipolar disorder database for genetic research. Bipolar disorder (BIP) is one of the most common hereditary psychiatric disorders worldwide. Elucidating the genetic basis of BIP will play a pivotal role in mechanistic delineation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully reported multiple susceptibility loci conferring BIP risk, thus providing insight into the effects of its underlying pathobiology. However, difficulties remain in the extrication of important and biologically relevant data from genetic discoveries related to psychiatric disorders such as BIP. There is an urgent need for an integrated and comprehensive online database with unified access to genetic and multi-omics data for in-depth data mining. Here, we developed the dbBIP, a database for BIP genetic research based on published data. The dbBIP consists of several modules, i.e.: (i) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) module, containing large-scale GWAS genetic summary statistics and functional annotation information relevant to risk variants; (ii) gene module, containing BIP-related candidate risk genes from various sources and (iii) analysis module, providing a simple and user-friendly interface to analyze one's own data. We also conducted extensive analyses, including functional SNP annotation, integration (including summary-data-based Mendelian randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies), co-expression, gene expression, tissue expression, protein-protein interaction and brain expression quantitative trait loci analyses, thus shedding light on the genetic causes of BIP. Finally, we developed a graphical browser with powerful search tools to facilitate data navigation and access. The dbBIP provides a comprehensive resource for BIP genetic research as well as an integrated analysis platform for researchers and can be accessed online at http://dbbip.xialab.info.

In addition, the distribution of functional elements in introns varies among different species. All the above data can be downloaded for free in this database. This database provides a concise, comprehensive and user-friendly web interface, allowing users to easily retrieve target data based on their needs, using relevant organizational options.

"35568950","SynBioStrainFinder: A microbial strain database of manually curated CRISPR/Cas genetic manipulation system information for biomanufacturing. Background Microbial strain information databases provide valuable data for microbial basic research and applications. However, they rarely contain information on the genetic operating system of microbial strains. Results We established a comprehensive microbial strain database, SynBioStrainFinder, by integrating CRISPR/Cas gene-editing system information with cultivation methods, genome sequence data, and compound-related information. It is presented through three modules, Strain2Gms/PredStrain2Gms, Strain2BasicInfo, and Strain2Compd, which combine to form a rapid strain information query system conveniently curated, integrated, and accessible on a single platform. To date, 1426 CRISPR/Cas gene-editing records of 157 microbial strains have been manually extracted from the literature in the Strain2Gms module. For strains without established CRISPR/Cas systems, the PredStrain2Gms module recommends the system of the most closely related strain as a reference to facilitate the construction of a new CRISPR/Cas gene-editing system. The database contains 139,499 records of strain cultivation and genome sequences, and 773,298 records of strain-related compounds. To facilitate simple and intuitive data application, all microbial strains are also labeled with stars based on the order and availability of strain information. SynBioStrainFinder provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing, and visualizing detailed information on microbial strains, and it is publicly available at http://design.rxnfinder.org/biosynstrain/ . Conclusion SynBioStrainFinder is the first microbial strain database with manually curated information on the strain CRISPR/Cas system as well as other microbial strain information. It also provides reference information for the construction of new CRISPR/Cas systems.

"36164976","DGPD: a knowledge database of dense granule proteins of the Apicomplexa. Apicomplexan parasites cause severe diseases in human and livestock. Dense granule proteins (GRAs), specific to the Apicomplexa, participate in the maintenance of intracellular parasitism of host cells. GRAs have better immunogenicity and they can be emerged as important players in vaccine development. Although studies on GRAs have increased gradually in recent years, due to incompleteness and complexity of data collection, biologists have difficulty in the comprehensive utilization of information. Thus, there is a desperate need of user-friendly resource to integrate with existing GRAs. In this paper, we developed the Dense Granule Protein Database (DGPD), the first knowledge database dedicated to the integration and analysis of typical GRAs properties. The current version of DGPD includes annotated GRAs metadata of 245 samples derived from multiple web repositories and literature mining, involving five species that cause common diseases (Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, Hammondia hammondi, Neospora caninum and Cystoisospora suis). We explored the baseline characteristics of GRAs and found that the number of introns and transmembrane domains in GRAs are markedly different from those of non-GRAs. Furthermore, we utilized the data in DGPD to explore the prediction algorithms for GRAs. We hope DGPD will be a good database for researchers to study GRAs.

"35348648, 25484339","Diseases 2.0: a weekly updated database of disease-gene associations from text mining and data integration. The scientific knowledge about which genes are involved in which diseases grows rapidly, which makes it difficult to keep up with new publications and genetics datasets. The DISEASES database aims to provide a comprehensive overview by systematically integrating and assigning confidence scores to evidence for disease-gene associations from curated databases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and automatic text mining of the biomedical literature. Here, we present a major update to this resource, which greatly increases the number of associations from all these sources. This is especially true for the text-mined associations, which have increased by at least 9-fold at all confidence cutoffs. We show that this dramatic increase is primarily due to adding full-text articles to the text corpus, secondarily due to improvements to both the disease and gene dictionaries used for named entity recognition, and only to a very small extent due to the growth in number of PubMed abstracts. DISEASES now also makes use of a new GWAS database, Target Illumination by GWAS Analytics, which considerably increased the number of GWAS-derived disease-gene associations. DISEASES itself is also integrated into several other databases and resources, including GeneCards/MalaCards, Pharos/Target Central Resource Database and the Cytoscape stringApp. All data in DISEASES are updated on a weekly basis and is available via a web interface at https://diseases.jensenlab.org, from where it can also be downloaded under open licenses.

"35373848","P-FLUX: A phosphorus budget dataset spanning diverse agricultural production systems in the United States and Canada. Quantifying spatial and temporal fluxes of phosphorus (P) within and among agricultural production systems is critical for sustaining agricultural production while minimizing environmental impacts. To better understand P fluxes in agricultural landscapes, P-FLUX, a detailed and harmonized dataset of P inputs, outputs, and budgets, as well as estimated uncertainties for each P flux and budget, was developed. Data were collected from 24 research sites and 61 production systems through the Long-term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network and partner organizations spanning 22 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces. The objectives of this paper are to (a) present and provide a description of the P-FLUX dataset, (b) provide summary analyses of the agricultural production systems included in the dataset and the variability in P inputs and outputs across systems, and (c) provide details for accessing the dataset, dataset limitations, and an example of future use. P-FLUX includes information on select site characteristics (area, soil series), crop rotation, P inputs (P application rate, source, timing, placement, P in irrigation water, atmospheric deposition), P outputs (crop removal, hydrologic losses), P budgets (agronomic budget, overall budget), uncertainties associated with each flux and budget, and data sources. Phosphorus fluxes and budgets vary across agricultural production systems and are useful resources to improve P use efficiency and develop management strategies to mitigate environmental impacts of agricultural systems.

"37860605","Medical Informatics Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository (MOVER): a public-access operating room database. Objectives Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming the healthcare industry. However, despite its potential, AI is yet to see widespread deployment in clinical settings in significant part due to the lack of publicly available clinical data and the lack of transparency in the published AI algorithms. There are few clinical data repositories publicly accessible to researchers to train and test AI algorithms, and even fewer that contain specialized data from the perioperative setting. To address this gap, we present and release the Medical Informatics Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository (MOVER). Materials and methods This first release of MOVER includes adult patients who underwent surgery at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center from 2015 to 2022. Data for patients who underwent surgery were captured from 2 different sources: High-fidelity physiological waveforms from all of the operating rooms were captured in real time and matched with electronic medical record data. Results MOVER includes data from 58 799 unique patients and 83 468 surgeries. MOVER is available for download at https://doi.org/10.24432/C5VS5G, it can be downloaded by anyone who signs a data usage agreement (DUA), to restrict traffic to legitimate researchers. Discussion To the best of our knowledge MOVER is the only freely available public data repository that contains electronic health record and high-fidelity physiological waveforms data for patients undergoing surgery. Conclusion MOVER is freely available to all researchers who sign a DUA, and we hope that it will accelerate the integration of AI into healthcare settings, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.","10/17/2023","http://doi.org/10.24432/C5VS5G","MOVER",0.912756204605102,"Medical Informatics Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository",0.952202518781026,"Medical Informatics Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository",0.952202519,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""
"37876351","A database for MR-based electrical properties tomography with in silico brain data-ADEPT. Purpose Several reconstruction methods for MR-based electrical properties tomography (EPT) have been developed. However, the lack of common data makes it difficult to objectively compare their performances. This is, however, a necessary precursor for standardizing and introducing this technique in the clinical setting. To enable objective comparison of the performances of reconstruction methods and provide common data for their training and testing, we created ADEPT, a database of simulated data for brain MR-EPT reconstructions. Methods ADEPT is a database containing in silico data for brain EPT reconstructions. This database was created from 25 different brain models, with and without tumors. Rigid geometric augmentations were applied, and different electrical properties were assigned to white matter, gray matter, CSF, and tumors to generate 120 different brain models. These models were used as input for finite-difference time-domain simulations in Sim4Life, used to compute the electromagnetic fields needed for MR-EPT reconstructions. Results Electromagnetic fields from 84 healthy and 36 tumor brain models were simulated. The simulated fields relevant for MR-EPT reconstructions (transmit and receive RF fields and transceive phase) and their ground-truth electrical properties are made publicly available through ADEPT. Additionally, nonattainable fields such as the total magnetic field and the electric field are available upon request. Conclusion ADEPT will serve as reference database for objective comparisons of reconstruction methods and will be a first step toward standardization of MR-EPT reconstructions. Furthermore, it provides a large amount of data that can be exploited to train data-driven methods.

"35723975","VIBFREQ1295: A New Database for Vibrational Frequency Calculations. High-throughput approaches for producing approximate vibrational spectral data for molecules of astrochemistry interest rely on harmonic frequency calculations using computational quantum chemistry. However, model chemistry recommendations (i.e., a level of theory and basis set pair) for these calculations are not yet available and, thus, thorough benchmarking against comprehensive benchmark databases is needed. Here, we present a new database for vibrational frequency calculations (VIBFREQ1295) storing 1295 experimental fundamental frequencies and CCSD(T)(F12*)/cc-pVDZ-F12 ab initio harmonic frequencies from 141 molecules. VIBFREQ1295's experimental data was complied through a comprehensive review of contemporary experimental data, while the ab initio data was computed here. The chemical space spanned by the molecules chosen is considered in-depth and is shown to have good representation of common organic functional groups and vibrational modes. Scaling factors are routinely used to approximate the effect of anharmonicity and convert computed harmonic frequencies to predicted fundamental frequencies. With our experimental and high-level ab initio data, we find that a single global uniform scaling factor of 0.9617(3) results in median differences of 15.9(5) cm-1. A far superior performance with a median difference of 7.5(5) cm-1 can be obtained, however, by using separate scaling factors (SFs) for three regions: frequencies less than 1000√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬âcm-1 (SF = 0.987(1)), between 1000 and 2000√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬âcm-1 (SF = 0.9727(6)), and above 2000√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬âcm-1 (SF = 0.9564(4)).

We previously published the Data Repository of Antimicrobial Peptides (DRAMP) as a manually annotated and open-access database of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In the update of version 3.0, special emphasis was placed on the new development of stapled AMPs, and a subclass of specific AMPs was added to store information on these special chemically modified AMPs. To help design low toxicity AMPs, we also added the cytotoxicity property of AMPs, as well as the expansion of newly discovered AMP data. At present, DRAMP has been expanded and contains 22259 entries (2360 newly added), consisting of 5891 general entries, 16110 patent entries, 77 clinical entries and 181 stapled AMPs. A total of 263 entries have predicted structures, and more than 300 general entries have links to experimentally determined structures in the Protein Data Bank.

"36334360","BS-80K: The first large open-access dataset of bone scan images. Background Radionuclide bone scanning is one of the most common tools in the inspection of bone metastasis. Conventionally, the analysis of bone scan image is derived from manual diagnosing. However, this task requires extensive subjective diagnostic experience and is extremely time-consuming. To this end, a series of studies concerning computer-aided diagnosis via machine learning tools have been proposed. Although some inspiring progress has been achieved, the implemented bone scan image datasets in these research areas are generally too small, private or non-general, which limits their practical significance and impedes the follow-up research. Method To address this issue, we present a large, publicly available and general dataset consisting of 82544 bone scan images associated with 3247 patients from West China Hospital, named BS-80K. In BS-80K, each patient provides two whole bone scan images corresponding to the anterior view (ANT) and the posterior view (POST). For each view, there are 13 region-wise slices of the body parts susceptible to bone metastasis. Based on an authorized original labeling criterion, labels annotated by experienced specialists are offered with the images. Moreover, within each whole body image, multiple bounding boxes containing suspectable hot spots and their annotations are supplied as well. All images in BS-80K have been de-identified to protect patients' privacy. Results Based on 6 popular deep learning models for classification and object detection, we provide the benchmark for a number of computer-aided medical tasks, including general bone metastasis prediction and object detection for whole body images, and specific bone metastasis prediction for different body parts. According to extensive experiments, the adopted classification models achieve remarkable results in accuracy and specificity (around 95%) on most metastasis prediction tasks, which are approximate to the average ability of corresponding specialists. As for the object detection task, the best average precision of the adopted models reaches 0.2484 and the lowest is 0.1334. Discussion Through the comparison of metastasis prediction performance between the benchmark and related work, we observe that the widely used models trained by BS-80K achieve significantly better results than the elaborately designed models trained by smaller datasets. This indicates that with the large amount of data, BS-80K has great potential to galvanize the research about computer-aided analysis on bone scan image. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, BS-80K is the first large publicly available dataset of bone scanning, which favors a wide range of research on computer-aided bone metastasis diagnosis.

Objective To facilitate the identification of related genes and candidate biomarkers for disorders of sex development (DSD), we present disorders of sex development atlas (http://dsd.geneworks.cn). Disorders of sex development are a spectrum of endocrine diseases with distinct mutations of genes or chromosomes, but several issues regarding their pathogenesis remain elusive. High-throughput methods have allowed genomic and transcriptomic analyses of DSD; however, these data are deposited in various repositories owing to a lack of integrated online resources. Design A descriptive study of a specialized gene discovery platform designed for DSD. Setting Publicly available DSD omics datasets and self-produced datasets. Patient(s)None. Intervention(s)None. Main outcome measure(s)The gene ranking result, with detailed information based on DSD terms in a gene-disease association knowledge base, and results of differential gene expression and mutation analyses from omics datasets. Result(s)The disorders of sex development atlas maintains both a knowledgebase for ranking DSD candidate genes and a database for DSD-related omics data analysis and visualization. We included 4 dominant classes of DSD in the knowledgebase: 15 subclasses and 44 specific disease names. Construction of the knowledgebase was centered upon Phenolyzer, with add-on seed gene databases customized by DSD-related genes collected from MalaCards, GeneCards, and DisGeNET.

X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy provide detailed information on the structures of biological assemblies, defined as the most likely biologically relevant structures derived from experimental data. In crystal structures, the most relevant assembly may be ambiguously determined, since multiple assemblies observed in the crystal lattice may be plausible. It is estimated that 10-15% of PDB entries may have incorrect or ambiguous assembly annotations. Accurate assemblies are required for understanding functional data and training of deep learning methods for predicting assembly structures.

"36018807","DupScan: predicting and visualizing vertebrate genome duplication database. Duplicated genes prevail in vertebrates and are important in the acquisition of new genes and novelties. Whole genome duplication (WGD) is one of the sources of duplicated genes. It can provide raw materials for natural selection by increasing the flexibility and complexity of the genome. WGDs are the driving force for the evolution of vertebrates and contribute greatly to their species diversity, especially in fish species with complicated WGD patterns. Here, we constructed the DupScan database (https://dupscan.sysumeg.com/) by integrating 106 chromosomal-level genomes, which can analyze and visualize synteny at both the gene and genome scales, visualize the Ka, Ks, and 4DTV values, and browse genomes. DupScan was used to perform functional adaptation for the intricate WGD investigation based on synteny matching. DupScan supports the analysis of five WGD rounds (R): VGD2 (vertebrate genome duplication 2), Ars3R (Acipenser-ruthenus-specific 3R), Pss3R (Polyodon-spathula-specific 3R), Ts3R (teleost-specific duplication 3R), Ss4R (salmonid-specific 4R), and Cs4R (carp-specific 4R). DupScan serves as one-stop analysis platform for synteny and WGD research in which users can analyze and predict synteny and WGD patterns across 106 species of whole genome sequences.

"37715195","Leveraging electronic medical records for HIV testing, care, and treatment programming in Kenya-the national data warehouse project. Background Aggregate electronic data repositories and population-level cross-sectional surveys play a critical role in HIV programme monitoring and surveillance for data-driven decision-making. However, these data sources have inherent limitations including inability to respond to public health priorities in real-time and to longitudinally follow up clients for ascertainment of long-term outcomes. Electronic medical records (EMRs) have tremendous potential to bridge these gaps when harnessed into a centralised data repository. We describe the evolution of EMRs and the development of a centralised national data warehouse (NDW) repository. Further, we describe the distribution and representativeness of data from the NDW and explore its potential for population-level surveillance of HIV testing, care and treatment in Kenya. Main body Health information systems in Kenya have evolved from simple paper records to web-based EMRs with features that support data transmission to the NDW. The NDW design includes four layers: data warehouse application programming interface (DWAPI), central staging, integration service, and data visualization application. The number of health facilities uploading individual-level data to the NDW increased from 666 in 2016 to 1,516 in 2020, covering 41 of 47 counties in Kenya. By the end of 2020, the NDW hosted longitudinal data from 1,928,458 individuals ever started on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In 2020, there were 936,869 individuals who were active on ART in the NDW, compared to 1,219,276 individuals on ART reported in the aggregate-level Kenya Health Information System (KHIS), suggesting 77% coverage. The proportional distribution of individuals on ART by counties in the NDW was consistent with that from KHIS, suggesting representativeness and generalizability at the population level. Conclusion The NDW presents opportunities for individual-level HIV programme monitoring and surveillance because of its longitudinal design and its ability to respond to public health priorities in real-time. A comparison with estimates from KHIS demonstrates that the NDW has high coverage and that the data maybe representative and generalizable at the population-level. The NDW is therefore a unique and complementary resource for HIV programme monitoring and surveillance with potential to strengthen timely data driven decision-making towards HIV epidemic control in Kenya.

"35013238","Helical structure motifs made searchable for functional peptide design. The systematic design of functional peptides has technological and therapeutic applications. However, there is a need for pattern-based search engines that help locate desired functional motifs in primary sequences regardless of their evolutionary conservation. Existing databases such as The Protein Secondary Structure database (PSS) no longer serves the community, while the Dictionary of Protein Secondary Structure (DSSP) annotates the secondary structures when tertiary structures of proteins are provided. Here, we extract 1.7 million helices from the PDB and compile them into a database (Therapeutic Peptide Design database; TP-DB) that allows queries of compounded patterns to facilitate the identification of sequence motifs of helical structures. We show how TP-DB helps us identify a known purification-tag-specific antibody that can be repurposed into a diagnostic kit for Helicobacter pylori.

"38282890","DynAMoS: The Dynamic Affective Movie Clip Database for Subjectivity Analysis. In this paper, we describe the design, collection, and validation of a new video database that includes holistic and dynamic emotion ratings from 83 participants watching 22 affective movie clips. In contrast to previous work in Affective Computing, which pursued a single ""ground truth"" label for the affective content of each moment of each video (e.g., by averaging the ratings of 2 to 7 trained participants), we embrace the subjectivity inherent to emotional experiences and provide the full distribution of all participants' ratings (with an average of 76.7 raters per video). We argue that this choice represents a paradigm shift with the potential to unlock new research directions, generate new hypotheses, and inspire novel methods in the Affective Computing community. We also describe several interdisciplinary use cases for the database: to provide dynamic norms for emotion elicitation studies (e.g., in psychology, medicine, and neuroscience), to train and test affective content analysis algorithms (e.g., for dynamic emotion recognition, video summarization, and movie recommendation), and to study subjectivity in emotional reactions (e.g., to identify moments of emotional ambiguity or ambivalence within movies, identify predictors of subjectivity, and develop personalized affective content analysis algorithms).

"36274129","EchinoDB: an update to the web-based application for genomic and transcriptomic data on echinoderms. Background Here we release a new version of EchinoDB, EchinoDB v2.0 ( https://echinodb.uncc.edu ). EchinoDB is a database of genomic and transcriptomic data on echinoderms. The initial database consisted of groups of 749,397 orthologous and paralogous transcripts arranged in orthoclusters by sequence similarity. Results The updated version of EchinoDB includes two new major datasets: the RNA-Seq data of the brittle star Ophioderma brevispinum and the high-quality genomic assembly data of the green sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. In addition, we enabled keyword searches for annotated data and installed an updated version of Sequenceserver to allow Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches. The data are downloadable in FASTA format. The first version of EchinoDB appeared in 2016 and was implemented in GO on a local server. The new version has been updated using R Shiny to include new features and improvements in the application. Furthermore, EchinoDB now runs entirely in the cloud for increased reliability and scaling. Conclusion EchinoDB serves a user base drawn from the fields of phylogenetics, developmental biology, genomics, physiology, neurobiology, and regeneration. As use cases, we illustrate the function of EchinoDB in retrieving components of signaling pathways involved in the tissue regeneration process of different echinoderms, including the emerging model species Ophioderma brevispinum. Moreover, we use EchinoDB to shed light on the conservation of the molecular components involved in two echinoderm-specific phenomena: spicule matrix proteins involved in the formation of stereom endoskeleton and the tensilin protein that contributes to the capacity of the connective tissues to quickly change its mechanical properties. The genes involved in the former had been previously studied in echinoids, while gene sequences involved in the latter had been previously described in holothuroids. Specifically, we ask (a) if the biomineralization-related proteins previously reported only in sea urchins are also present in other, non-echinoid, echinoderms and (b) if tensilin, the protein responsible for the control of stiffness of the mutable collagenous tissue, previously described in sea cucumbers, is conserved across the phylum.","10/23/2022","http://echinodb.uncc.edu","EchinoDB",0.996249437332153,"",0,"EchinoDB",0.996249437,1,"","26800861","","","","merge all ""dup name"" IDs","",NA,""

"36318263","EDomics: a comprehensive and comparative multi-omics database for animal evo-devo. Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has been among the most fascinating interdisciplinary fields for decades, which aims to elucidate the origin and evolution of diverse developmental processes. The rapid accumulation of omics data provides unprecedented opportunities to answer many interesting but unresolved evo-devo questions. However, the access and utilization of these resources are hindered by challenges particularly in non-model animals. Here, we establish a comparative multi-omics database for animal evo-devo (EDomics, http://edomics.qnlm.ac) containing comprehensive genomes, bulk transcriptomes, and single-cell data across 40 representative species, many of which are generally used as model organisms for animal evo-devo study. EDomics provides a systematic view of genomic/transcriptomic information from various aspects, including genome assembly statistics, gene features and families, transcription factors, transposable elements, and gene expressional profiles/networks. It also exhibits spatiotemporal gene expression profiles at a single-cell level, such as cell atlas, cell markers, and spatial-map information. Moreover, EDomics provides highly valuable, customized datasets/resources for evo-devo research, including gene family expansion/contraction, inferred core gene repertoires, macrosynteny analysis for karyotype evolution, and cell type evolution analysis.

"34761274","scEnhancer: a single-cell enhancer resource with annotation across hundreds of tissue/cell types in three species. Previous studies on enhancers and their target genes were largely based on bulk samples that represent 'average' regulatory activities from a large population of millions of cells, masking the heterogeneity and important effects from the sub-populations. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has enabled the profiling of open chromatin accessibility at the single-cell level (scATAC-seq), which can be used to annotate the enhancers and promoters in specific cell types. A comprehensive resource is highly desirable for exploring how the enhancers regulate the target genes at the single-cell level. Hence, we designed a single-cell database scEnhancer (http://enhanceratlas.net/scenhancer/), covering 14 527 776 enhancers and 63 658 600 enhancer-gene interactions from 1 196 906 single cells across 775 tissue/cell types in three species. An unsupervised learning method was employed to sort and combine tens or hundreds of single cells in each tissue/cell type to obtain the consensus enhancers. In addition, we utilized a cis-regulatory network algorithm to identify the enhancer-gene connections. Finally, we provided a user-friendly platform with seven useful modules to search, visualize, and browse the enhancers/genes. This database will facilitate the research community towards a functional analysis of enhancers at the single-cell level.","1/1/2022","http://enhanceratlas.net/scenhancer","scEnhancer",0.996709287166596,"",0,"scEnhancer",0.996709287,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37691964","Comprehensive regulatory networks for tomato organ development based on the genome and RNAome of MicroTom tomato. MicroTom has a short growth cycle and high transformation efficiency, and is a prospective model plant for studying organ development, metabolism, and plant-microbe interactions. Here, with a newly assembled reference genome for this tomato cultivar and abundant RNA-seq data derived from tissues of different organs/developmental stages/treatments, we constructed multiple gene co-expression networks, which will provide valuable clues for the identification of important genes involved in diverse regulatory pathways during plant growth, e.g. arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and fruit development. Additionally, non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were also identified, together with their potential targets. Interacting networks between different types of non-coding RNAs (miRNA-lncRNA), and non-coding RNAs and genes (miRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-mRNA) were constructed as well. Our results and data will provide valuable information for the study of organ differentiation and development of this important fruit. Lastly, we established a database (http://eplant.njau.edu.cn/microTomBase/) with genomic and transcriptomic data, as well as details of gene co-expression and interacting networks on MicroTom, and this database should be of great value to those who want to adopt MicroTom as a model plant for research.","7/19/2023","http://eplant.njau.edu.cn/microTomBase","MicroTom",0.97959840297699,"",0,"MicroTom",0.979598403,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

'Esophageal cancer' (EC) is a highly aggressive and deadly complex disease. It comprises two types, esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), with Barrett's esophagus (BE) being the only known precursor. Recent research has revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in the development, prognosis and treatment of EC and are involved in various human diseases. Biological databases have become essential for cancer research as they provide information on genes, proteins, pathways and their interactions. These databases collect, store and manage large amounts of molecular data, which can be used to identify patterns, predict outcomes and generate hypotheses. However, no comprehensive database exists for EC and miRNA relationships. To address this gap, we developed a dynamic database named 'ESOMIR (miRNA in esophageal cancer) (https://esomir.dqweilab-sjtu.com)', which includes information about targeted genes and miRNAs associated with EC. The database uses analysis and prediction methods, including experimentally endorsed miRNA(s) information. ESOMIR is a user-friendly interface that allows easy access to EC-associated data by searching for miRNAs, target genes, sequences, chromosomal positions and associated signaling pathways. The search modules are designed to provide specific data access to users based on their requirements. Additionally, the database provides information about network interactions, signaling pathways and region information of chromosomes associated with the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) or 5'UTR and exon sites. Users can also access energy levels of specific miRNAs with targeted genes. A fuzzy term search is included in each module to enhance the ease of use for researchers. ESOMIR can be a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians to gain insight into EC, including identifying biomarkers and treatments for this aggressive tumor.

Sequencing technological advances have enabled genome-wide analysis of ER action. However, comparison of individual studies is limited by different experimental designs, and few meta-analyses are available. Here, we established the EstroGene database through unified processing of data from 246 experiments including 136 transcriptomic, cistromic, and epigenetic datasets focusing on estradiol (E2)-triggered ER activation across 19 breast cancer cell lines. A user-friendly browser (https://estrogene.org/) was generated for multiomic data visualization involving gene inquiry under user-defined experimental conditions and statistical thresholds. Notably, annotation of metadata associated with public datasets revealed a considerable lack of experimental details. Comparison of independent RNA-seq or ER ChIP-seq data with the same design showed large variability and only strong effects could be consistently detected. Temporal estrogen response metasignatures were defined, and the association of E2 response rate with temporal transcriptional factors, chromatin accessibility, and heterogeneity of ER expression was evaluated. Unexpectedly, harmonizing 146 E2-induced transcriptomic datasets uncovered a subset of genes harboring bidirectional E2 regulation, which was linked to unique transcriptional factors and highly associated with immune surveillance in the clinical setting. Furthermore, the context dependent E2 response programs were characterized in MCF7 and T47D cell lines, the two most frequently used models in the EstroGene database. Collectively, the EstroGene database provides an informative and practical resource to the cancer research community to uniformly evaluate key reproducible features of ER regulomes and unravels modes of ER signaling. Significance A resource database integrating 246 publicly available ER profiling datasets facilitates meta-analyses and identifies estrogen response temporal signatures, a bidirectional program, and model-specific biases.","8/1/2023","http://estrogene.org","EstroGene",0.985920906066894,"",0,"EstroGene",0.985920906,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36732606, 27924041, 31724701","The human microbial exposome: expanding the Exposome-Explorer database with gut microbial metabolites. Metabolites produced by the gut microbiota play an important role in the cross-talk with the human host. Many microbial metabolites are biologically active and can pass the gut barrier and make it into the systemic circulation, where they form the gut microbial exposome, i.e. the totality of gut microbial metabolites in body fluids or tissues of the host. A major difficulty faced when studying the microbial exposome and its role in health and diseases is to differentiate metabolites solely or partially derived from microbial metabolism from those produced by the host or coming from the diet. Our objective was to collect data from the scientific literature and build a database on gut microbial metabolites and on evidence of their microbial origin. Three types of evidence on the microbial origin of the gut microbial exposome were defined: (1) metabolites are produced in vitro by human faecal bacteria; (2) metabolites show reduced concentrations in humans or experimental animals upon treatment with antibiotics; (3) metabolites show reduced concentrations in germ-free animals when compared with conventional animals. Data was manually collected from peer-reviewed publications and inserted in the Exposome-Explorer database. Furthermore, to explore the chemical space of the microbial exposome and predict metabolites uniquely formed by the microbiota, genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) of gut bacterial strains and humans were compared. A total of 1848 records on one or more types of evidence on the gut microbial origin of 457 metabolites was collected in Exposome-Explorer. Data on their known precursors and concentrations in human blood, urine and faeces was also collected. About 66% of the predicted gut microbial metabolites (n√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â=√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â1543) were found to be unique microbial metabolites not found in the human GSMM, neither in the list of 457 metabolites curated in Exposome-Explorer, and can be targets for new experimental studies.

The aim of the study is to establish an online database for predicting protein structures altered in ocular diseases by Alphafold2 and RoseTTAFold algorithms. Totally, 726 genes of multiple ocular diseases were collected for protein structure prediction. Both Alphafold2 and RoseTTAFold algorithms were built locally using the open-source codebases. A dataset with 48 protein structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB) was adopted for algorithm set-up validation. A website was built to match ocular genes with the corresponding predicted tertiary protein structures for each amino acid sequence.

Molecular dynamics and molecular docking simulations were performed to demonstrate the applications of the predicted structures. For the validation dataset, 70.8% of the predicted protein structures showed pLDDT greater than 90. Compared to the PDB structures, 100% of the AlphaFold2-predicted structures and 97.9% of the RoseTTAFold-predicted structure showed TM score greater than 0.5. Totally, 1329 amino acid sequences of 430 ocular disease-related genes have been predicted, of which 75.9% showed pLDDT greater than 70 for the wildtype sequences and 76.1% for the variant sequences. Small molecule docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the predicted protein structures with higher confidence scores showed similar molecular characteristics with the structures from PDB. We have developed an ocular protein structure database (EyeProdb) for ocular disease, which is released for the public and will facilitate the biological investigations and structure-based drug development for ocular diseases.

"36350676","FAVOR: functional annotation of variants online resource and annotator for variation across the human genome. Large biobank-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies are rapidly identifying a multitude of coding and non-coding variants. They provide an unprecedented resource for illuminating the genetic basis of human diseases.

"35876977","FEAMR: A Database for Surveillance of Food and Environment-Associated Antimicrobial Resistance. The rapid dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a serious health problem on an unprecedented global scale. AMR is predicted to kill more than 10 million people annually by 2050 leading to huge economic losses worldwide. Therefore, urgent action is required at the national as well as international levels to avert this looming crisis. Effective surveillance can play an important role in the containment of AMR spread by providing data to help determine AMR hotspots, predict an outbreak, maintain proper stewardship and propose immediate and future plans of action in this respect. Although many existing databases provide genetic and molecular information on AMR in microorganisms, there is no dedicated database of AMR from non-clinical samples. The FEAMR database is a one-of-its-kind database to provide manually collated and curated information on the prevalence of AMR in food and the environment. For designing the FEAMR webpage, Microsoft Visual Studio with HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, Bootstrap for the front-end and C# for the back-end were used. The FEAMR database is a free access resource ( https://feamrudbt-amrlab.mu.ac.in/ ), accepting verified food- and environment-related AMR submissions from across the globe. To the best of our knowledge, it is probably the first database providing AMR-related surveillance data from non-clinical samples. It is designed from the 'One Health Approach' perspective to help in the containment of global AMR spread. Flowsheet of steps for making FEAMR database 1. Research articles relating to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) were searched on the internet. 2. Data relating to AMR were retrieved from these articles and stored in an MS-Excel sheet. 3. The web pages of the FEAMR database (DB) were created using Microsoft Visual Studio (MVS) and its various tools. HTML, CSS, ASP.NET and Bootstrap were used for the front end and C# used for the back-end of the website. 4. The DB of FEAMR was created using MS SQL Server which was controlled by SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). 5. The data from the MS-Excel sheet in step 2 was stored in the SQL server and displayed on the web page using GridView tool of MVS and C#. The database created was then uploaded on the University of Mumbai (UoM) website, where it can be accessed by all users having the link to the DB ( https://feamrudbt-amrlab.mu.ac.in/ ).","7/25/2022","http://feamrudbt-amrlab.mu.ac.in","FEAMR",0.98639977,"",0,"FEAMR",0.9863997698,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Fusarium graminearum is ranked among the five most destructive fungal pathogens that affect agroecosystems. It causes floral diseases in small grain cereals including wheat, barley, and oats, as well as maize and rice. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies reporting species within the F. graminearum species complex (FGSC) and created two main data tables. The first contained summarized data from the articles including bibliographic, geographic, methodological (ID methods), host of origin and species, while the second data table contains information about the described strains such as publication, isolate code(s), host/substrate, year of isolation, geographical coordinates, species and trichothecene genotype. Analyses of the bibliographic data obtained from 123 publications from 2000 to 2021 by 498 unique authors and published in 40 journals are summarized. We describe the frequency of species and chemotypes for 16,274 strains for which geographical information was available, either provided as raw data or extracted from the publications, and sampled across six continents and 32 countries. The database and interactive interface are publicly available, allowing for searches, summarization, and mapping of strains according to several criteria including article, country, host, species and trichothecene genotype. The database will be updated as new articles are published and should be useful for guiding future surveys and exploring factors associated with species distribution such as climate and land use.

"37625584","K-Pro: Kinetics Data on Proteins and Mutants. The study of protein folding plays a crucial role in improving our understanding of protein function and of the relationship between genetics and phenotypes. In particular, understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of the folding process is important for uncovering the mechanisms behind human disorders caused by protein misfolding. To address this issue, it is essential to collect and curate experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data on protein folding. K-Pro is a new database designed for collecting and storing experimental kinetic data on monomeric proteins, with a two-state folding mechanism.

One primary curation task is to assign up to eight topics (e.g. Diagnosis and Treatment) to the articles in LitCovid. The annotated topics have been widely used for navigating the COVID literature, rapidly locating articles of interest and other downstream studies. However, annotating the topics has been the bottleneck of manual curation. Despite the continuing advances in biomedical text-mining methods, few have been dedicated to topic annotations in COVID-19 literature. To close the gap, we organized the BioCreative LitCovid track to call for a community effort to tackle automated topic annotation for COVID-19 literature. The BioCreative LitCovid dataset-consisting of over 30√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â000 articles with manually reviewed topics-was created for training and testing. It is one of the largest multi-label classification datasets in biomedical scientific literature. Nineteen teams worldwide participated and made 80 submissions in total. Most teams used hybrid systems based on transformers. The highest performing submissions achieved 0.8875, 0.9181 and 0.9394 for macro-F1-score, micro-F1-score and instance-based F1-score, respectively. Notably, these scores are substantially higher (e.g. 12%, higher for macro F1-score) than the corresponding scores of the state-of-art multi-label classification method. The level of participation and results demonstrate a successful track and help close the gap between dataset curation and method development.

"36458799","NLM-Chem-BC7: manually annotated full-text resources for chemical entity annotation and indexing in biomedical articles. The automatic recognition of chemical names and their corresponding database identifiers in biomedical text is an important first step for many downstream text-mining applications. The task is even more challenging when considering the identification of these entities in the article's full text and, furthermore, the identification of candidate substances for that article's metadata [Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) article indexing]. The National Library of Medicine (NLM)-Chem track at BioCreative VII aimed to foster the development of algorithms that can predict with high quality the chemical entities in the biomedical literature and further identify the chemical substances that are candidates for article indexing. As a result of this challenge, the NLM-Chem track produced two comprehensive, manually curated corpora annotated with chemical entities and indexed with chemical substances: the chemical identification corpus and the chemical indexing corpus. The NLM-Chem BioCreative VII (NLM-Chem-BC7) Chemical Identification corpus consists of 204 full-text PubMed Central (PMC) articles, fully annotated for chemical entities by 12 NLM indexers for both span (i.e.√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†named entity recognition) and normalization (i.e.√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†entity linking) using MeSH. This resource was used for the training and testing of the Chemical Identification task to evaluate the accuracy of algorithms in predicting chemicals mentioned in recently published full-text articles. The NLM-Chem-BC7 Chemical Indexing corpus consists of 1333 recently published PMC articles, equipped with chemical substance indexing by manual experts at the NLM. This resource was used for the evaluation of the Chemical Indexing task, which evaluated the accuracy of algorithms in predicting the chemicals that should be indexed, i.e.√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†appear in the listing of MeSH terms for the document. This set was further enriched after the challenge in two ways: (i) 11 NLM indexers manually verified each of the candidate terms appearing in the prediction results of the challenge participants, but not in the MeSH indexing, and the chemical indexing terms appearing in the MeSH indexing list, but not in the prediction results, and (ii) the challenge organizers algorithmically merged the chemical entity annotations in the full text for all predicted chemical entities and used a statistical approach to keep those with the highest degree of confidence. As a result, the NLM-Chem-BC7 Chemical Indexing corpus is a gold-standard corpus for chemical indexing of journal articles and a silver-standard corpus for chemical entity identification in full-text journal articles. Together, these resources are currently the most comprehensive resources for chemical entity recognition, and we demonstrate improvements in the chemical entity recognition algorithms. We detail the characteristics of these novel resources and make them available for the community.

"35641095","FUNAGE-Pro: comprehensive web server for gene set enrichment analysis of prokaryotes. Recent advances in the field of high throughput (meta-)transcriptomics and proteomics call for easy and rapid methods enabling to explore not only single genes or proteins but also extended biological systems. Gene set enrichment analysis is commonly used to find relations in a set of genes and helps to uncover the biological meaning in results derived from high-throughput data. The basis for gene set enrichment analysis is a solid functional classification of genes. Here, we describe a comprehensive database containing multiple functional classifications of genes of all (>55 000) publicly available complete bacterial genomes.

"37841644","Mapping global non-floodplain wetlands. Non-floodplain wetlands - those located outside the floodplains - have emerged as integral components to watershed resilience, contributing hydrologic and biogeochemical functions affecting watershed-scale flooding extent, drought magnitude, and water-quality maintenance. However, the absence of a global dataset of non-floodplain wetlands limits their necessary incorporation into water quality and quantity management decisions and affects wetland-focused wildlife habitat conservation outcomes. We addressed this critical need by developing a publicly available ""Global NFW"" (Non-Floodplain Wetland) dataset, comprised of a global river-floodplain map at 90 m resolution coupled with a global ensemble wetland map incorporating multiple wetland-focused data layers. The floodplain, wetland, and non-floodplain wetland spatial data developed here were successfully validated within 21 large and heterogenous basins across the conterminous United States. We identified nearly 33 million potential non-floodplain wetlands with an estimated global extent of over 16√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬ó106 km2. Non-floodplain wetland pixels comprised 53% of globally identified wetland pixels, meaning the majority of the globe's wetlands likely occur external to river floodplains and coastal habitats. The identified global NFWs were typically small (median 0.039 km2), with a global median size ranging from 0.018-0.138 km2. This novel geospatial Global NFW static dataset advances wetland conservation and resource-management goals while providing a foundation for global non-floodplain wetland functional assessments, facilitating non-floodplain wetland inclusion in hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological model development.

"35971612","GAIA: G-quadruplexes in alive creature database. G-quadruplexes (G4) are 3D structures that are found in both DNA and RNA. Interest in this structure has grown over the past few years due to both its implication in diverse biological mechanisms and its potential use as a therapeutic target, to name two examples. G4s in humans have been widely studied; however, the level of their study in other species remains relatively minimal. That said, progress in this field has resulted in the prediction of G4s structures in various species, ranging from bacteria to eukaryotes. These predictions were analysed in a previous study which revealed that G4s are present in all living kingdoms. To date, eleven different databases have grouped the various G4s depending on either their structures, on the proteins that might bind them, or on their location in the various genomes. However, none of these databases contains information on their location in the transcriptome of many of the implicated species. The GAIA database was designed so as to make this data available online in a user-friendly manner. Through its web interface, users can query GAIA to filter G4s, which, we hope, will help the research in this field.

Atomic-level knowledge of protein-ligand interactions allows a detailed understanding of protein functions and provides critical clues to discovering molecules regulating the functions.

A new database, HProteome-BSite, provides predictions of binding sites and ligands in the enlarged 3D human proteome. The model structures for human proteins from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database were processed to structural domains of high confidence to maximize the coverage and reliability of interaction prediction. For ligand binding site prediction, an updated version of a template-based method GalaxySite was used. A high-level performance of the updated GalaxySite was confirmed. HProteome-BSite covers 80.74% of the UniProt entries in the AlphaFold human 3D proteome.

Synteny conservation analysis is a well-established methodology to investigate the potential functional role of unknown prokaryotic genes. However, bioinformatic tools to reconstruct and visualise genomic contexts usually depend on slow computations, are restricted to narrow taxonomic ranges, and/or do not allow for the functional and interactive exploration of neighbouring genes across different species. Here, we present GeCoViz, an online resource built upon 12 221 reference prokaryotic genomes that provides fast and interactive visualisation of custom genomic regions anchored by any target gene, which can be sought by either name, orthologous group (KEGGs, eggNOGs), protein domain (PFAM) or sequence. To facilitate functional and evolutionary interpretation, GeCoViz allows to customise the taxonomic scope of each analysis and provides comprehensive annotations of the neighbouring genes. Interactive visualisation options include, among others, the scaled representations of gene lengths and genomic distances, and on the fly calculation of synteny conservation of neighbouring genes, which can be highlighted based on custom thresholds. The resulting plots can be downloaded as high-quality images for publishing purposes.

"35061087","NucPosDB: a database of nucleosome positioning in vivo and nucleosomics of cell-free DNA. Nucleosome positioning is involved in many gene regulatory processes happening in the cell, and it may change as cells differentiate or respond to the changing microenvironment in a healthy or diseased organism. One important implication of nucleosome positioning in clinical epigenetics is its use in the ""nucleosomics"" analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for the purpose of patient diagnostics in liquid biopsies. The rationale for this is that the apoptotic nucleases that digest chromatin of the dying cells mostly cut DNA between nucleosomes. Thus, the short pieces of DNA in body fluids reflect the positions of nucleosomes in the cells of origin. Here, we report a systematic nucleosomics database - NucPosDB - curating published nucleosome positioning datasets in vivo as well as datasets of sequenced cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that reflect nucleosome positioning in situ in the cells of origin. Users can select subsets of the database by a number of criteria and then obtain raw or processed data. NucPosDB also reports the originally determined regions with stable nucleosome occupancy across several individuals with a given condition. An additional section provides a catalogue of computational tools for the analysis of nucleosome positioning or cfDNA experiments and theoretical algorithms for the prediction of nucleosome positioning preferences√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†from DNA sequence.

"34551437","CSCD2: an integrated interactional database of cancer-specific circular RNAs. The significant function of circRNAs in cancer was recognized in recent work, so a well-organized resource is required for characterizing the interactions between circRNAs and other functional molecules (such as microRNA and RNA-binding protein) in cancer. We previously developed cancer-specific circRNA database (CSCD), a comprehensive database for cancer-specific circRNAs, which is widely used in circRNA research. Here, we updated CSCD to CSCD2 (http://geneyun.net/CSCD2 or http://gb.whu.edu.cn/CSCD2), which includes significantly more cancer-specific circRNAs identified from a large number of human cancer and normal tissues/cell lines.

In recent years, there are a huge influx of genomic data and a growing need for its phenotypic correlations, yet existing genomic databases do not allow easy storage and accessibility to the combined phenotypic-genotypic information. Freely accessible allele frequency (AF) databases, such as gnomAD, are crucial for evaluating variants but lack correlated phenotype data. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accumulates hundreds of thousands of next-generation sequencing (NGS) samples tagged by their submitters and various attributes. However, samples are stored in large raw format files, inaccessible for a common user. To make thousands of NGS samples and their corresponding additional attributes easily available to clinicians and researchers, we generated a pipeline that continuously downloads raw human NGS data uploaded to SRA using SRAtoolkit and preprocesses them using GATK pipeline. Data are then stored efficiently in a cloud data lake and can be accessed via a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API) and a user-friendly website. We thus generated GeniePool, a simple and intuitive web service and API for querying NGS data from SRA with direct access to information related to each sample and related studies, providing significant advantages over existing databases for both clinical and research usages. Utilizing data lake infrastructure, we were able to generate a multi-purpose tool that can serve many clinical and research use cases. We expect users to explore the meta-data served via GeniePool both in daily clinical practice and in versatile research endeavours.

"37747225","Consensus-Based Development of a Global Registry for Traumatic Brain Injury: Establishment, Protocol, and Implementation. Background and objectives Global disparity exists in the demographics, pathology, management, and outcomes of surgically treated traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the factors underlying these differences, including intervention effectiveness, remain unclear. Establishing a more accurate global picture of the burden of TBI represents a challenging task requiring systematic and ongoing data collection of patients with TBI across all management modalities. The objective of this study was to establish a global registry that would enable local service benchmarking against a global standard, identification of unmet need in TBI management, and its evidence-based prioritization in policymaking. Methods The registry was developed in an iterative consensus-based manner by a panel of neurotrauma professionals. Proposed registry objectives, structure, and data points were established in 2 international multidisciplinary neurotrauma meetings, after which a survey consisting of the same data points was circulated within the global neurotrauma community. The survey results were disseminated in a final meeting to reach a consensus on the most pertinent registry variables. Results A total of 156 professionals from 53 countries, including both high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries, responded to the survey. The final consensus-based registry includes patients with TBI who required neurosurgical admission, a neurosurgical procedure, or a critical care admission. The data set comprised clinically pertinent information on demographics, injury characteristics, imaging, treatments, and short-term outcomes. Based on the consensus, the Global Epidemiology and Outcomes following Traumatic Brain Injury (GEO-TBI) registry was established. Conclusion The GEO-TBI registry will enable high-quality data collection, clinical auditing, and research activity, and it is supported by the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and the National Institute of Health Research Global Health Program. The GEO-TBI registry ( https://geotbi.org ) is now open for participant site recruitment. Any center involved in TBI management is welcome to join the collaboration to access the registry.","9/25/2023","http://geotbi.org","GEO-TBI",0.908446441094081,"Global Epidemiology and Outcomes following Traumatic Brain Injury",0.885301790454171,"GEO-TBI",0.908446441,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"37856620","GIFTdb: a useful gene database for plant fruit traits improving. Fruit traits are critical determinants of plant fitness, resource diversity, productive and quality. Gene regulatory networks in plants play an essential role in determining fruit traits, such as fruit size, yield, firmness, aroma and other important features. Many research studies have focused on elucidating the associated signaling pathways and gene interaction mechanism to better utilize gene resources for regulating fruit traits. However, the availability of specific database of genes related to fruit traits for use by the plant research community remains limited. To address this limitation, we developed the Gene Improvements for Fruit Trait Database (GIFTdb, http://giftdb.agroda.cn).

Although an increasing number of species-specific databases have been constructed to facilitate the global research community, comprehensive databases remain rare with multidimensional research resources rather than genomic data solely, in particular for non-model species. Here we introduced GinkgoDB, the ecological genome database for the world-renowned living fossil, Ginkgo biloba L., a tree species with extreme longevity, exceptional resistance, global landscape application and dioecy. The present version of GinkgoDB consists of four modules of genome, occurrence, quadrat and gallery. The genome module includes two versions of chromosome-level assembled genomes with high-quality annotation, expression profiles of each sex for different tissues and variants from 545 ginkgo genomes. A suite of tools were also deployed online for search, blast and further analyses. The occurrence module contains distribution information of over one million records across the world with an emphasis on 8926 individual-level tagged trees with phenotypic trait data in eastern Asia. The quadrat module provides monitoring data of both species and habitats from 27 plots of natural ginkgo forests and periodic data of functional traits measured for the entire plant communities. The gallery module collects field morphological photos and scanned phenotypic images of various ginkgo materials.

Gliomas are the most frequent malignant and aggressive tumors in the central nervous system. Early and effective diagnosis of glioma using diagnostic biomarkers can prolong patients' lives and aid in the development of new personalized treatments. Therefore, a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic biomarkers in gliomas is of great significance. To this end, we developed the integrated and web-based database GlioMarker (http://gliomarker.prophetdb.org/), the first comprehensive database for knowledge exploration of glioma diagnostic biomarkers. In GlioMarker, accurate information on 406 glioma diagnostic biomarkers from 1559 publications was manually extracted, including biomarker descriptions, clinical information, associated literature, experimental records, associated diseases, statistical indicators, etc. Importantly, we integrated many external resources to provide clinicians and researchers with the capability to further explore knowledge on these diagnostic biomarkers based on three aspects. (1) Obtain more ontology annotations of the biomarker. (2) Identify the relationship between any two or more components of diseases, drugs, genes, and variants to explore the knowledge related to precision medicine. (3) Explore the clinical application value of a specific diagnostic biomarker through online analysis of genomic and expression data from glioma cohort studies. GlioMarker provides a powerful, practical, and user-friendly web-based tool that may serve as a specialized platform for clinicians and researchers by providing rapid and comprehensive knowledge of glioma diagnostic biomarkers to subsequently facilitates high-quality research and applications.","8/11/2022","http://gliomarker.prophetdb.org","GlioMarker",0.994303107261658,"",0,"GlioMarker",0.994303107,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36680885","GlucoKinaseDB: A comprehensive, curated resource of glucokinase modulators for clinical and molecular research. Glucokinase (GK), an isoform of hexokinase expressed predominantly in liver, pancreas and hypothalamus is crucial to blood glucose management. It is a critical component of the glucose-sensing mechanism of the pancreatic islet cells and glycogen regulation in hepatocytes. GK modulators such as allosteric GKAs (glucokinase activators) and GK-GKRP (glucokinase regulatory protein) disruptors have found potential applications as safer antihyperglycemics. Recent studies have also demonstrated the potential of GK modulators as antiparasitic agents. Researchers targeting GK often undertake the time-consuming task of independently collecting and compiling modulator information due to the lack of any dedicated single-platform resource. Towards this, in the present study we demonstrate the design and development of GlucoKinaseDB (GKDB), a comprehensive, curated, online resource of GK modulators. GKDB contains experimentally derived structural and bioactivity information of 1723 modulators along with their detailed molecular descriptors. The web-interface is user-friendly with features such as in-browser visualization, advanced search queries, cross-links to other databases and original reference etc. The bioactivity and descriptor data can be downloaded in bulk (for entire database) or for individual modulators. The 3D structures are also downloadable in multiple formats. GKDB employs a PHP-based web design with Bootstrap styling and a MySQL database backend. GKDB can be utilized for clinical and molecular research via development of pharmacophore hypotheses, QSAR/QSPR models, predictive machine learning models etc. GKDB is freely accessible online at https://glucokinasedb.in.","1/18/2023","http://glucokinasedb.in","GKDB",0.992191791534424,"",0,"GKDB",0.992191792,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Therefore, we here updated the database to include the new available information. Our newly updated database shows several improvements: (i) it comprises more entries and families because it includes both Acrs reported in the most recent literatures and Acrs obtained via performing homologous alignment; (ii) the prediction of Acr neighbors is integrated into Anti-CRISPRdb v2.2, and users can identify novel Acrs from these candidates; and (iii) this version includes experimental information on the inhibitory strength and stage for Acr-Cas/Acr-CRISPR pairs, motivating the development of tools for predicting specific inhibitory abilities. Additionally, a parameter, the rank of codon usage bias (CUBRank), was proposed and provided in the new version, which showed a positive relationship with predicted result from AcRanker; hence, it can be used as an indicator for proteins to be Acrs.

Background The natural products, metabolites, of gut microbes are crucial effect factors on diseases. Comprehensive identification and annotation of relationships among disease, metabolites, and microbes can provide efficient and targeted solutions towards understanding the mechanism of complex disease and development of new markers and drugs. Results We developed Gut Microbial Metabolite Association with Disease (GMMAD), a manually curated database of associations among human diseases, gut microbes, and metabolites of gut microbes. Here, this initial release (i) contains 3,836 disease-microbe associations and 879,263 microbe-metabolite associations, which were extracted from literatures and available resources and then experienced our manual curation; (ii) defines an association strength score and a confidence score. With these two scores, GMMAD predicted 220,690 disease-metabolite associations, where the metabolites all belong to the gut microbes. We think that the positive effective (with both scores higher than suggested thresholds) associations will help identify disease marker and understand the pathogenic mechanism from the sense of gut microbes. The negative effective associations would be taken as biomarkers and have the potential as drug candidates. Literature proofs supported our proposal with experimental consistence; (iii) provides a user-friendly web interface that allows users to browse, search, and download information on associations among diseases, metabolites, and microbes.

"35799352","HARIBOSS: a curated database of RNA-small molecules structures to aid rational drug design. Motivation RNA molecules are implicated in numerous fundamental biological processes and many human pathologies, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, muscular diseases and bacterial infections. Modulating the mode of action of disease-implicated RNA molecules can lead to the discovery of new therapeutical agents and even address pathologies linked to 'undruggable' protein targets. This modulation can be achieved by direct targeting of RNA with small molecules. As of today, only a few RNA-targeting small molecules are used clinically. One of the main obstacles that have hampered the development of a rational drug design protocol to target RNA with small molecules is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of RNA-small molecule (RNA-SM) recognition. Results Here, we present Harnessing RIBOnucleic acid-Small molecule Structures (HARIBOSS), a curated collection of RNA-SM structures determined by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. HARIBOSS facilitates the exploration of drug-like compounds known to bind RNA, the analysis of ligands and pockets properties and ultimately the development of in silico strategies to identify RNA-targeting small molecules.

"34986599","HIT 2.0: an enhanced platform for Herbal Ingredients' Targets. Literature-described targets of herbal ingredients have been explored to facilitate the mechanistic study of herbs, as well as the new drug discovery. Though several databases provided similar information, the majority of them are limited to literatures before 2010 and need to be updated urgently. HIT 2.0 was here constructed as the latest curated dataset focusing on Herbal Ingredients' Targets covering PubMed literatures 2000-2020. Currently, HIT 2.0 hosts 10 031 compound-target activity pairs with quality indicators between 2208 targets and 1237 ingredients from more than 1250 reputable herbs. The molecular targets cover those genes/proteins being directly/indirectly activated/inhibited, protein binders, and enzymes substrates or products. Also included are those genes regulated under the treatment of individual ingredient. Crosslinks were made to databases of TTD, DrugBank, KEGG, PDB, UniProt, Pfam, NCBI, TCM-ID and others. More importantly, HIT enables automatic Target-mining and My-target curation from daily released PubMed literatures. Thus, users can retrieve and download the latest abstracts containing potential targets for interested compounds, even for those not yet covered in HIT. Further, users can log into 'My-target' system, to curate personal target-profiling on line based on retrieved abstracts.

"34986597","HMDB 5.0: the Human Metabolome Database for 2022. The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB (https://hmdb.ca) has been providing comprehensive reference information about human metabolites and their associated biological, physiological and chemical properties since 2007. Over the past 15 years, the HMDB has grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes in internet and computing technology. This year's update, HMDB 5.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades to the database. These should make the HMDB more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of metabolite entries (from 114 100 to 217 920 compounds); (ii) enhancements to the quality and depth of metabolite descriptions; (iii) the addition of new structure, spectral and pathway visualization tools; (iv) the inclusion of many new and much more accurately predicted spectral data sets, including predicted NMR spectra, more accurately predicted MS spectra, predicted retention indices and predicted collision cross section data and (v) enhancements to the HMDB's search functions to facilitate better compound identification. Many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface, and general performance of the HMDB website have also been made. Overall, we believe these upgrades and updates should greatly enhance the HMDB's ease of use and its potential applications not only in human metabolomics but also in exposomics, lipidomics, nutritional science, biochemistry and clinical chemistry.","1/1/2022","http://hmdb.ca","HMDB",0.984358310699463,"Human Metabolome Database",0.946645092964172,"HMDB",0.984358311,1,"","37639797","","","","do not merge","",NA,""

"36208223","HSDatabase-a database of highly similar duplicate genes from plants, animals, and algae. Gene duplication is an important evolutionary mechanism capable of providing new genetic material, which in some instances can help organisms adapt to various environmental conditions. Recent studies, for example, have indicated that highly similar duplicate genes (HSDs) are aiding adaptation to extreme conditions via gene dosage. However, for most eukaryotic genomes HSDs remain uncharacterized, partly because they can be hard to identify and categorize efficiently and effectively. Here, we collected and curated HSDs in nuclear genomes from various model animals, land plants and algae and indexed them in an online, open-access sequence repository called HSDatabase. Currently, this database contains 117√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â864 curated HSDs from 40 distinct genomes; it includes statistics on the total number of HSDs per genome as well as individual HSD copy numbers/lengths and provides sequence alignments of the duplicate gene copies.

What is more, a built-in Basic Local Alignment Search Tool option is available to conveniently explore potential homologous sequences of interest within and across species. HSDatabase has a user-friendly interface and provides easy access to the source data. It can be used on its own for comparative analyses of gene duplicates or in conjunction with HSDFinder, a newly developed bioinformatics tool for identifying, annotating, categorizing and visualizing HSDs.

"35697698","A database of anti-coronavirus peptides. Since 2019, the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) disease (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide epidemic. Anti-coronavirus peptides (ACovPs), a type of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have demonstrated excellent inhibitory effects on coronaviruses. However, state-of-the-art AMP databases contain only a small number of ACovPs. Additionally, the fields of these databases are not uniform, and the units or evaluation standards of the same field are inconsistent. Most of these databases have not included the target domains of ACovPs and description of in vitro and in vivo assays to measure the inhibitory effects of ACovPs. Here, we present a database focused on ACovPs (ACovPepDB), which contains comprehensive and precise ACovPs information of 518 entries with 214 unique ACovPs manually collected from public databases and published peer-reviewed articles. We believe that ACovPepDB is of great significance for facilitating the development of new peptides and improving treatment for coronavirus infection.

"36068786","AGODB: a comprehensive domain annotation database of argonaute proteins. Argonaute (Ago) proteins are widely expressed in almost all organisms. Eukaryotic Ago (eAgo) proteins bind small RNA guides forming RNA-induced silencing complex that silence gene expression, and prokaryotic Ago (pAgo) proteins defend against invading nucleic acids via binding small RNAs or DNAs. pAgo proteins have shown great potential as a candidate 'scissors' for gene editing. Protein domains are fundamental units of protein structure, function and evolution; however, the domains of Ago proteins are not well annotated/curated currently. Therefore, full functional domain annotation of Ago proteins is urgently needed for researchers to understand the function and mechanism of Ago proteins. Herein, we constructed the first comprehensive domain annotation database of Ago proteins (AGODB). The database curates detailed information of 1902 Ago proteins, including 1095 eAgos and 807 pAgos. Especially for long pAgo proteins, all six domains are annotated and curated. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that Ago genes in different species were enriched in the following GO terms: biological processes (BPs), molecular function and cellular compartment. GO enrichment analysis results were integrated into AGODB, which provided insights into the BP that Ago genes may participate in. AGODB also allows users to search the database with a variety of options and download the search results. We believe that the AGODB will be a useful resource for understanding the function and domain components of Ago proteins.

ICARUS (Integrated Chamber Atmospheric data Repository for Unified Science) is an open access, searchable, web-based infrastructure for storing, sharing, discovering, and utilizing atmospheric chamber data [https://icarus.ucdavis.edu]. ICARUS has two parts: a data intake portal and a search and discovery portal. Data in ICARUS are curated, uniform, interactive, indexed on popular search engines, mirrored by other repositories, version-tracked, vocabulary-controlled, and citable. ICARUS hosts both legacy data and new data in compliance with open access data mandates. Targeted data discovery is available based on key experimental parameters, including organic reactants and mixtures that are managed using the PubChem chemical database, oxidant information, nitrogen oxide (NOx) content, alkylperoxy radical (RO2) fate, seed particle information, environmental conditions, and reaction categories. A discipline-specific repository such as ICARUS with high amounts of metadata works to support the evaluation and revision of atmospheric model mechanisms, intercomparison of data and models, and the development of new model frameworks that can have more predictive power in the current and future atmosphere.

However, data interpretation is hampered by our limited knowledge on functions, biological contexts, or precipitating enzymes of the phosphosites. This study establishes a repository of phosphosites with associated evidence in biomedical abstracts, using deep learning-based natural language processing techniques. Our model for illuminating the dark phosphoproteome through PubMed mining (IDPpub) was generated by fine-tuning BioBERT, a deep learning tool for biomedical text mining. Trained using sentences containing protein substrates and phosphorylation site positions from 3000 abstracts, the IDPpub model was then used to extract phosphorylation sites from all MEDLINE abstracts. The extracted proteins were normalized to gene symbols using the National Center for Biotechnology Information gene query, and sites were mapped to human UniProt sequences using ProtMapper and mouse UniProt sequences by direct match. Precision and recall were calculated using 150 curated abstracts, and utility was assessed by analyzing the CPTAC (Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium) pan-cancer phosphoproteomics datasets and the PhosphoSitePlus database. Using 10-fold cross validation, pairs of correct substrates and phosphosite positions were extracted with an average precision of 0.93 and recall of 0.94. After entity normalization and site mapping to human reference sequences, an independent validation achieved a precision of 0.91 and recall of 0.77. The IDPpub repository contains 18,458 unique human phosphorylation sites with evidence sentences from 58,227 abstracts and 5918 mouse sites in 14,610 abstracts. This included evidence sentences for 1803 sites identified in CPTAC studies that are not covered by manually curated functional information in PhosphoSitePlus.

Overall, REGLIV is unique in (a) providing the molecular regulation of a clearly defined regulatory direction other than simple correlation, (b) focusing on molecular regulations that are validated in a living system not simply in an in vitro test, and (c) describing the disease/tissue/species specific property underlying each regulation. Therefore, REGLIV has important implications for the future practice of not only multiomics, but also other fields relevant to molecular regulation.

"38157777","RVvictor: Virus RNA-directed molecular interactions for RNA virus infection. RNA viruses are major human pathogens that cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemic outbreaks. Due to the nature of their RNA genomes, it is anticipated that virus's RNA interacts with host protein (INTPRO), messenger RNA (INTmRNA), and non-coding RNA (INTncRNA) to perform their particular functions during their transcription and replication. In other words, thus, it is urgently needed to have such valuable data on virus RNA-directed molecular interactions (especially INTPROs), which are highly anticipated to attract broad research interests in the fields of RNA virus translation and replication. In this study, a new database was constructed to describe the virus RNA-directed interaction (INTPRO, INTmRNA, INTncRNA) for RNA virus (RVvictor). This database is unique in a) unambiguously characterizing the interactions between viruses RNAs and host proteins, b) providing, for the first time, the most systematic RNA-directed interaction data resources in providing clues to understand the molecular mechanisms of RNA viruses' translation, and replication, and c) in RVvictor, comprehensive enrichment analysis is conducted for each virus RNA based on its associated target genes/proteins, and the enrichment results were explicitly illustrated using various graphs. We found significant enrichment of a suite of pathways related to infection, translation, and replication, e.g., HIV infection, coronavirus disease, regulation of viral genome replication, and so on. Due to the devastating and persistent threat posed by the RNA virus, RVvictor constructed, for the first time, a possible network of cross-talk in RNA-directed interaction, which may ultimately explain the pathogenicity of RNA virus infection. The knowledge base might help develop new anti-viral therapeutic targets in the future.

Little millet (Panicum sumatrense) a native of Chhattisgarh, belongs to the minor millet group and is primarily known as a climate-resilient and nutritionally rich crop. However, due to the lack of enough Omic studies on the crop, the scientific community has largely remained unaware of the potential of this crop, resulting in less scope for its utilization in crop improvement programs. Looking at global warming, erratic climate change, nutritional security, and limited genetic information available, the Little Millet Transcriptome Database (LMTdb) (https://igkv.ac.in/xenom/index.aspx) was conceptualized upon completion of the transcriptome sequencing of little millet with the aim of deciphering the genetic signatures of this largely unknown crop. The database was developed with the view of providing information about the most comprehensive part of the genome, the 'Transcriptome'.

"36503126","iHypoxia: An Integrative Database of Protein Expression Dynamics in Response to Hypoxia in Animals. Mammals have evolved mechanisms to sense hypoxia and induce hypoxic responses. Recently, high-throughput techniques have greatly promoted global studies of protein expression changes during hypoxia and the identification of candidate genes associated with hypoxia-adaptive evolution, which have contributed to the understanding of the complex regulatory networks of hypoxia. In this study, we developed an integrated resource for the expression dynamics of proteins in response to hypoxia (iHypoxia), and this database contains 2589 expression events of 1944 proteins identified by low-throughput experiments (LTEs) and 422,553 quantitative expression events of 33,559 proteins identified by high-throughput experiments from five mammals that exhibit a response to hypoxia. Various experimental details, such as the hypoxic experimental conditions, expression patterns, and sample types, were carefully collected and integrated. Furthermore, 8788 candidate genes from diverse species inhabiting low-oxygen environments were also integrated. In addition, we conducted an orthologous search and computationally identified 394,141 proteins that may respond to hypoxia among 48 animals. An enrichment analysis of human proteins identified from LTEs shows that these proteins are enriched in certain drug targets and cancer genes. Annotation of known posttranslational modification (PTM) sites in the proteins identified by LTEs reveals that these proteins undergo extensive PTMs, particularly phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation. iHypoxia provides a convenient and user-friendly method for users to obtain hypoxia-related information of interest. We anticipate that iHypoxia, which is freely accessible at https://ihypoxia.omicsbio.info, will advance the understanding of hypoxia and serve as a valuable data resource.","12/9/2022","http://ihypoxia.omicsbio.info","iHypoxia",0.987089217,"",0,"iHypoxia",0.9870892167,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"34893873","MODOMICS: a database of RNA modification pathways. 2021 update. The MODOMICS database has been, since 2006, a manually curated and centralized resource, storing and distributing comprehensive information about modified ribonucleosides. Originally, it only contained data on the chemical structures of modified ribonucleosides, their biosynthetic pathways, the location of modified residues in RNA sequences, and RNA-modifying enzymes. Over the years, prompted by the accumulation of new knowledge and new types of data, it has been updated with new information and functionalities. In this new release, we have created a catalog of RNA modifications linked to human diseases, e.g., due to mutations in genes encoding modification enzymes. MODOMICS has been linked extensively to RCSB Protein Data Bank, and sequences of experimentally determined RNA structures with modified residues have been added. This expansion was accompanied by including nucleotide 5'-monophosphate residues. We redesigned the web interface and upgraded the database backend. In addition, a search engine for chemically similar modified residues has been included that can be queried by SMILES codes or by drawing chemical molecules. Finally, previously available datasets of modified residues, biosynthetic pathways, and RNA-modifying enzymes have been updated. Overall, we provide users with a new, enhanced, and restyled tool for research on RNA modification.

"35487995","ImitateDB: A database for domain and motif mimicry incorporating host and pathogen protein interactions. Molecular mimicry of host proteins by pathogens constitutes a strategy to hijack the host pathways. At present, there is no dedicated resource for mimicked domains and motifs in the host-pathogen interactome. In this work, the experimental host-pathogen (HP) and host-host (HH) protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were collated. The domains and motifs of these proteins were annotated using CD Search and ScanProsite, respectively. Host and pathogen proteins with a shared host interactor and similar domain/motif constitute a mimicry pair exhibiting global structural similarity (domain mimicry pair; DMP) or local sequence motif similarity (motif mimicry pair; MMP). Mimicry pairs are likely to be co-expressed and co-localized. 1,97,607 DMPs and 32,67,568 MMPs were identified in 49,265 experimental HP-PPIs and organized in a web-based resource, ImitateDB ( http://imitatedb.sblab-nsit.net ) that can be easily queried. The results are externally integrated using hyperlinked domain PSSM ID, motif ID, protein ID and PubMed ID. Kinase, UL36, Smc and DEXDc were frequent DMP domains whereas protein kinase C phosphorylation, casein kinase 2 phosphorylation, glycosylation and myristoylation sites were frequent MMP motifs.

"36459564","Meta-Analysis of Human Cancer Single-Cell RNA-Seq Datasets Using the IMMUcan Database. The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has greatly contributed to deciphering the tumor microenvironment (TME). An enormous amount of independent scRNA-seq studies have been published representing a valuable resource that provides opportunities for meta-analysis studies. However, the massive amount of biological information, the marked heterogeneity and variability between studies, and the technical challenges in processing heterogeneous datasets create major bottlenecks for the full exploitation of scRNA-seq data. We have developed IMMUcan scDB (https://immucanscdb.vital-it.ch), a fully integrated scRNA-seq database exclusively dedicated to human cancer and accessible to nonspecialists. IMMUcan scDB encompasses 144 datasets on 56 different cancer types, annotated in 50 fields containing precise clinical, technological, and biological information. A data processing pipeline was developed and organized in four steps: (i) data collection; (ii) data processing (quality control and sample integration); (iii) supervised cell annotation with a cell ontology classifier of the TME; and (iv) interface to analyze TME in a cancer type-specific or global manner. This framework was used to explore datasets across tumor locations in a gene-centric (CXCL13) and cell-centric (B cells) manner as well as to conduct meta-analysis studies such as ranking immune cell types and genes correlated to malignant transformation. This integrated, freely accessible, and user-friendly resource represents an unprecedented level of detailed annotation, offering vast possibilities for downstream exploitation of human cancer scRNA-seq data for discovery and validation studies.

"35363305","ImmuMethy, a database of DNA methylation plasticity at a single cytosine resolution in human blood and immune cells. Differential DNA methylation is a feature of numerous physiological and pathological processes.

In this study, we carried out a systematic analysis of methylome data derived from human blood and immune cells and constructed the ImmuMethy database. ImmuMethy allows interrogation of DNA methylation plasticity (MPL) at the single cytosine level.

An analysis of all datasets revealed that DNA methylation is generally stable, with minimal changes in beta values. This further supports the characteristics of DNA methylation homeostasis. Based on the beta value distribution, we identified three types of methylation sites: methylation tendency sites, unmethylation tendency sites and dual tendency or nonbiased methylation sites. These sites represent different methylation tendentiousness of DNA methylation across samples. The occurrence of multiple methylation tendencies in a site means split methylation, which generally corresponds to high MPL. Inverted methylation tendencies from methylation tendency sites to unmethylation tendency sites, or vice versa, represent strong differential methylation in response to conditions. All these sites can be identified in ImmuMethy, making it a useful tool for omics-based data-driven knowledge discovery.

"36764355","InParanoiDB 9: Ortholog Groups for Protein Domains and Full-Length Proteins. Prediction of orthologs is an important bioinformatics pursuit that is frequently used for inferring protein function and evolutionary analyses. The InParanoid database is a well known resource of ortholog predictions between a wide variety of organisms. Although orthologs have historically been inferred at the level of full-length protein sequences, many proteins consist of several independent protein domains that may be orthologous to domains in other proteins in a way that differs from the full-length protein case. To be able to capture all types of orthologous relations, conventional full-length protein orthologs can be complemented with orthologs inferred at the domain level. We here present InParanoiDB 9, covering 640 species and providing orthologs for both protein domains and full-length proteins. InParanoiDB 9 was built using the faster InParanoid-DIAMOND algorithm for orthology analysis, as well as Domainoid and Pfam to infer orthologous domains. InParanoiDB 9 is based on proteomes from 447 eukaryotes, 158 bacteria and 35 archaea, and includes over one billion predicted ortholog groups. A new website has been built for the database, providing multiple search options as well as visualization of groups of orthologs and orthologous domains.

"35111182","The Grape Gene Reference Catalogue as a Standard Resource for Gene Selection and Genetic Improvement. Effective crop improvement, whether through selective breeding or biotech strategies, is largely dependent on the cumulative knowledge of a species' pangenome and its containing genes. Acquiring this knowledge is specially challenging in grapevine, one of the oldest fruit crops grown worldwide, which is known to have more than 30,000 genes. Well-established research communities studying model organisms have created and maintained, through public and private funds, a diverse range of online tools and databases serving as repositories of genomes and gene function data. The lack of such resources for the non-model, but economically important, Vitis vinifera species has driven the need for a standardised collection of genes within the grapevine community. In an effort led by the Integrape COST Action CA17111, we have recently developed the first grape gene reference catalogue, where genes are ascribed to functional data, including their accession identifiers from different genome-annotation versions (https://integrape.eu/resources/genes-genomes/). We present and discuss this gene repository together with a validation-level scheme based on varied supporting evidence found in current literature.

"36275459","isomiRTar: a comprehensive portal of pan-cancer 5'-isomiR targeting. Inaccurate cleavage of pri- and pre-miRNA hairpins by Drosha and Dicer results in the generation of miRNA isoforms known as isomiRs. isomiRs with 5'-end variations (5'-isomiRs) create a new dimension in miRNA research since they have different seed regions and distinct targetomes. We developed isomiRTar (https://isomirtar.hse.ru)-a comprehensive portal that allows one to analyze expression profiles and targeting activity of 5'-isomiRs in cancer. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas sequencing data, we compiled the list of 1022 5'-isomiRs expressed in 9282 tumor samples across 31 cancer types. Sequences of these isomiRs were used to predict target genes with miRDB and TargetScan. The putative interactions were then subjected to the co-expression analysis in each cancer type to identify isomiR-target pairs supported by significant negative correlations. Downstream analysis of the data deposited in isomiRTar revealed both cancer-specific and cancer-conserved 5'-isomiR expression landscapes. Pairs of isomiRs differing in one nucleotide shift from 5'-end had poorly overlapping targetomes with the median Jaccard index of 0.06. The analysis of colorectal cancer 5'-isomiR-mediated regulatory networks revealed promising candidate tumor suppressor isomiRs: hsa-miR-203a-3p-+1, hsa-miR-192-5p-+1 and hsa-miR-148a-3p-0. In summary, we believe that isomiRTar will help researchers find novel mechanisms of isomiR-mediated gene silencing in different types of cancer.","10/17/2022","http://isomirtar.hse.ru)-a","isomiRTar",0.987943172,"",0,"isomiRTar",0.9879431725,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

A new IUCLID database is provided containing results from non-clinical animal studies and human information for 530 approved drugs. The database was developed by extracting data from pharmacological reviews of repeat-dose, carcinogenicity, developmental, and reproductive toxicity studies. In the database, observed and no-observed effects are linked to the respective effect levels, including information on severity/incidence and transiency/reversibility. It also includes some information on effects in humans, that were extracted from relevant sections of standard product labels of the approved drugs. The database is complemented with a specific ontology for reporting effects that was developed as an improved version of the Ontology Lookup Service's mammalian and human phenotype ontologies and includes different hierarchical levels. The developed ontology contains novel and unique standardized terms, including ontological terms for reproductive and endocrine effects. The database aims to facilitate correlation and concordance analyses based on the link between observed and no-observed effects and their respective effect levels. In addition, it offers a robust dataset on drug information for the pharmaceutical industry and research. The reported ontology supports the analyses of toxicological information, especially for reproductive and endocrine endpoints and can be used to encode legacy data or develop additional ontologies. The new database and ontology can be used to support the development of alternative non-animal approaches, to elucidate mechanisms of toxicity, and to analyse human relevance.

"35842742","PlantPhoneDB: A manually curated pan-plant database of ligand-receptor pairs infers cell-cell communication. Ligand-receptor pairs play important roles in cell-cell communication for multicellular organisms in response to environmental cues. Recently, the emergence of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate cellular communication based on ligand-receptor expression. However, so far, no reliable ligand-receptor interaction database is available for plant species. In this study, we developed PlantPhoneDB (https://jasonxu.shinyapps.io/PlantPhoneDB/), a pan-plant database comprising a large number of high-confidence ligand-receptor pairs manually curated from seven resources. Also, we developed a PlantPhoneDB R package, which not only provided optional four scoring approaches that calculate interaction scores of ligand-receptor pairs between cell types but also provided visualization functions to present analysis results. At the PlantPhoneDB web interface, the processed datasets and results can be searched, browsed, and downloaded. To uncover novel cell-cell communication events in plants, we applied the PlantPhoneDB R package on GSE121619 dataset to infer significant cell-cell interactions of heat-shocked root cells in Arabidopsis thaliana. As a result, the PlantPhoneDB predicted the actively communicating AT1G28290-AT2G14890 ligand-receptor pair in atrichoblast-cortex cell pair in Arabidopsis thaliana. Importantly, the downstream target genes of this ligand-receptor pair were significantly enriched in the ribosome pathway, which facilitated plants adapting to environmental changes. In conclusion, PlantPhoneDB provided researchers with integrated resources to infer cell-cell communication from scRNA-seq datasets.","7/30/2022","http://jasonxu.shinyapps.io/PlantPhoneDB","PlantPhoneDB",0.994704008,"",0,"PlantPhoneDB",0.9947040081,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37605971","The Database of European Forest Insect and Disease Disturbances: DEFID2. Insect and disease outbreaks in forests are biotic disturbances that can profoundly alter ecosystem dynamics. In many parts of the world, these disturbance regimes are intensifying as the climate changes and shifts the distribution of species and biomes. As a result, key forest ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, regulation of water flows, wood production, protection of soils, and the conservation of biodiversity, could be increasingly compromised. Despite the relevance of these detrimental effects, there are currently no spatially detailed databases that record insect and disease disturbances on forests at the pan-European scale. Here, we present the new Database of European Forest Insect and Disease Disturbances (DEFID2). It comprises over 650,000 harmonized georeferenced records, mapped as polygons or points, of insects and disease disturbances that occurred between 1963 and 2021 in European forests. The records currently span eight different countries and were acquired through diverse methods (e.g., ground surveys, remote sensing techniques). The records in DEFID2 are described by a set of qualitative attributes, including severity and patterns of damage symptoms, agents, host tree species, climate-driven trigger factors, silvicultural practices, and eventual sanitary interventions. They are further complemented with a satellite-based quantitative characterization of the affected forest areas based on Landsat Normalized Burn Ratio time series, and damage metrics derived from them using the LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation algorithm (including onset, duration, magnitude, and rate of the disturbance), and possible interactions with windthrow and wildfire events. The DEFID2 database is a novel resource for many large-scale applications dealing with biotic disturbances. It offers a unique contribution to design networks of experiments, improve our understanding of ecological processes underlying biotic forest disturbances, monitor their dynamics, and enhance their representation in land-climate models. Further data sharing is encouraged to extend and improve the DEFID2 database continuously.

"37523674","JustRNA: a database of plant long noncoding RNA expression profiles and functional network. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regulatory RNAs involved in numerous biological processes. Many plant lncRNAs have been identified, but their regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. A resource that enables the investigation of lncRNA activity under various conditions is required because the co-expression between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes may reveal the effects of lncRNAs. This study developed JustRNA, an expression profiling resource for plant lncRNAs. The platform currently contains 1 088 565 lncRNA annotations for 80 plant species. In addition, it includes 3692 RNA-seq samples derived from 825 conditions in six model plants. Functional network reconstruction provides insight into the regulatory roles of lncRNAs. Genomic association analysis and microRNA target prediction can be employed to depict potential interactions with nearby genes and microRNAs, respectively. Subsequent co-expression analysis can be employed to strengthen confidence in the interactions among genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data of transcription factors and histone modifications were integrated into the JustRNA platform to identify the transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs in several plant species. The JustRNA platform provides researchers with valuable insight into the regulatory mechanisms of plant lncRNAs.

"37682529, 27087309","Kalium 3.0 is a comprehensive depository of natural, artificial, and labeled polypeptides acting on potassium channels. Here, we introduce the third release of Kalium database (http://kaliumdb.org/), a manually curated comprehensive depository that accumulates data on polypeptide ligands of potassium channels. The major goal of this amplitudinous update is to summarize findings for natural polypeptide ligands of K+ channels, as well as data for the artificial derivatives of these substances obtained over the decades of exploration. We manually analyzed more than 700 original manuscripts and systematized the information on mutagenesis, production of radio- and fluorescently labeled derivatives, and the molecular pharmacology of K+ channel ligands. As a result, data on more than 1200 substances were processed and added enriching the database content fivefold. We also included the electrophysiological data obtained on the understudied and neglected K+ channels including the heteromeric and concatenated channels. We associated target channels in Kalium with corresponding entries in the official database of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. Kalium was supplemented with an adaptive Statistics page, where users are able to obtain actual data output. Several other improvements were introduced, such as a color code to distinguish the range of ligand activity concentrations and advanced tools for filtration and sorting. Kalium is a fully open-access database, crosslinked to other databases of interest. It can be utilized as a convenient resource containing ample up-to-date information about polypeptide ligands of K+ channels.","11/1/2023","http://kaliumdb.org","Kalium",0.988748372,"",0,"Kalium",0.988748372,2,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Cilia are found in eukaryotic species ranging from single-celled organisms, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to humans, but not in plants. The ability to respond to repellents and/or attractants, regulate cell proliferation and differentiation and provide cellular mobility are just a few examples of how crucial cilia are to cells and organisms. Over 30 distinct rare disorders generally known as ciliopathy are caused by abnormalities or functional impairments in cilia and cilia-related compartments. Because of the complexity of ciliopathies and the rising number of ciliopathies and ciliopathy genes, a ciliopathy-oriented and up-to-date database is required. Here, we present CiliaMiner, a manually curated ciliopathy database that includes ciliopathy lists collected from articles and databases. Analysis reveals that there are 55 distinct disorders likely related to ciliopathy, with over 4000 clinical manifestations. Based on comparative symptom analysis and subcellular localization data, diseases are classified as primary, secondary or atypical ciliopathies. CiliaMiner provides easy access to all of these diseases and disease genes, as well as clinical features and gene-specific clinical features, as well as subcellular localization of each protein. Additionally, the orthologs of disease genes are also provided for mice, zebrafish, Xenopus, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

"36155273","Knowledgebase of potential multifaceted solutions to antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a top threat to global health, challenges preventive and treatment strategies of infections. AMR strains of microbial pathogens arise through multiple mechanisms. The underlying ""antibiotic resistance genes"" (ARGs) spread through various species by lateral gene transfer thereby causing global dissemination. Human methods also augment this process through inappropriate use, non-compliance to treatment schedule, and environmental waste. Worldwide significant efforts are being invested to discover novel therapeutic solutions for tackling resistant pathogens. Diverse therapeutic strategies have evolved over recent years. In this work we have developed a comprehensive knowledgebase by collecting alternative antimicrobial therapeutic strategies from literature data. Therapeutic strategies against bacteria, virus, fungus and parasites were extracted from PubMed literature using text mining. We have used a subjective (sentimental) approach for data mining new strategies, resulting in broad coverage of novel entities and subsequently add objective data like entity name (including IUPAC), potency, and safety information. The extracted data was organized in a freely accessible web platform, KOMBAT. The KOMBAT comprises 1104 Chemical compounds, 220 of newly identified antimicrobial peptides, 42 bacteriophages, 242 phytochemicals, 106 nanocomposites, and 94 novel entities for phototherapy. Entities tested and evaluated on AMR pathogens are included. We envision that this database will be useful for developing future therapeutics against AMR pathogens.

"37828369","LAMPPrimerBank, a manually curated database of experimentally validated loop-mediated isothermal amplification primers for detection of respiratory pathogens. Purpose and methods The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has once again affirmed the significant threat of respiratory infections to global public health and the utmost importance of prompt diagnosis in managing and mitigating any pandemic. The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is the primary detection method for most pathogens. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid, simple, sensitive, and specific epitome of isothermal NAAT performed using a set of four to six primers. Primer design is a fundamental step in LAMP assays, with several complexities and experimental screening requirements. To address this challenge, an online database is presented here. Its workflow comprises three steps: literature aggregation, data curation, and database and website implementation. Results LAMPPrimerBank ( https://lampprimerbank.mathematik.uni-marburg.de ) is a manually curated database dedicated to experimentally validated LAMP primers, their peculiarities of assays, and accompanying literature, with a primary emphasis on respiratory pathogens. LAMPPrimerBank, with its user-friendly web interface and an open application programming interface, enables the accelerated and facile exploration, comparison, and exportation of LAMP primer sequences and their respective information from the massively scattered literature. LAMPPrimerBank currently comprises LAMP primers for diagnosing viral, bacterial, and fungal respiratory pathogens. Additionally, to address the challenge of false-positive results generated by nonspecific amplifications, LAMPPrimerBank computationally predicted and visualized the sizes of LAMP products for recorded primer sets in the database. Conclusion LAMPPrimerBank, as a pioneering database in the rapidly expanding field of isothermal NAAT, endeavors to confront the two challenges of the LAMP: primer design and discrimination of false-positive results.","10/12/2023","http://lampprimerbank.mathematik.uni-marburg.de","LAMPPrimerBank",0.841362416744232,"",0,"LAMPPrimerBank",0.841362417,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

Leishmaniasis is a detrimental disease causing serious changes in quality of life and some forms can lead to death. The disease is spread by the parasite Leishmania transmitted by sandfly vectors and their primary hosts are vertebrates including humans. The pathogen penetrates host cells and secretes proteins (the secretome) to repurpose cells for pathogen growth and to alter cell signaling via host-pathogen protein-protein interactions). Here, we present LeishMANIAdb, a database specifically designed to investigate how Leishmania virulence factors may interfere with host proteins. Since the secretomes of different Leishmania species are only partially characterized, we collated various experimental evidence and used computational predictions to identify Leishmania secreted proteins to generate a user-friendly unified web resource allowing users to access all information available on experimental and predicted secretomes. In addition, we manually annotated host-pathogen interactions of 211 proteins and the localization/function of 3764 transmembrane (TM) proteins of different Leishmania species. We also enriched all proteins with automatic structural and functional predictions that can provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms of infection. Our database may provide novel insights into Leishmania host-pathogen interactions and help to identify new therapeutic targets for this neglected disease.

"37530436","LIRcentral: a manually curated online database of experimentally validated functional LIR motifs. Several selective macroautophagy receptor and adaptor proteins bind members of the Atg8 (autophagy related 8) family using short linear motifs (SLiMs), most often referred to as Atg8-family interacting motifs (AIMs) or LC3-interacting regions (LIRs). AIM/LIR motifs have been extensively studied during the last fifteen years, since they can uncover the underlying biological mechanisms and possible substrates for this key catabolic process of eukaryotic cells. Prompted by the fact that experimental information regarding LIR motifs can be found scattered across heterogeneous literature resources, we have developed LIRcentral (https://lircentral.eu), a freely available online repository for user-friendly access to comprehensive, high-quality information regarding LIR motifs from manually curated publications. Herein, we describe the development of LIRcentral and showcase currently available data and features, along with our plans for the expansion of this resource. Information incorporated in LIRcentral is useful for accomplishing a variety of research tasks, including: (i) guiding wet biology researchers for the characterization of novel instances of LIR motifs, (ii) giving bioinformaticians/computational biologists access to high-quality LIR motifs for building novel prediction methods for LIR motifs and LIR containing proteins (LIRCPs) and (iii) performing analyses to better understand the biological importance/features of functional LIR motifs. We welcome feedback on the LIRcentral content and functionality by all interested researchers and anticipate this work to spearhead a community effort for sustaining this resource which will further promote progress in studying LIR motifs/LIRCPs.Abbreviations: AIM, Atg8-family interacting motif; Atg8, autophagy related 8; GABARAP, GABA type A receptor-associated protein; LIR, LC3-interacting region; LIRCP, LIR-containing protein; MAP1LC3/LC3, microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; PMID, PubMed identifier; PPI, protein-protein interaction; SLiM, short linear motif.","8/2/2023","http://lircentral.eu","LIRcentral",0.995626866817474,"",0,"LIRcentral",0.995626867,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Neoantigens derived from somatic deoxyribonucleic acid alterations are ideal cancer-specific targets. However, integrated platform for neoantigen discovery is urgently needed. Recently, many scattered experimental evidences suggest that some neoantigens are immunogenic, and comprehensive collection of these experimentally validated neoantigens is still lacking. Here, we have integrated the commonly used tools in the current neoantigen discovery process to form a comprehensive web-based analysis platform. To identify experimental evidences supporting the immunogenicity of neoantigens, we performed comprehensive literature search and constructed the database. The collection of public neoantigens was obtained by using comprehensive features to filter the potential neoantigens from recurrent driver mutations. Importantly, we constructed a graph neural network (GNN) model (Immuno-GNN) using an attention mechanism to consider the spatial interactions between human leukocyte antigen and antigenic peptides for neoantigen immunogenicity prediction. The new easy-to-use R/Shiny web-based neoantigen database and discovery platform, Neodb, contains currently the largest number of experimentally validated neoantigens. In addition to validated neoantigen, Neodb also includes three additional modules for facilitating neoantigen prediction and analysis, including 'Tools' module (comprehensive neoantigen prediction tools); 'Driver-Neo' module (collection of public neoantigens derived from recurrent mutations) and 'Immuno-GNN' module (a novel immunogenicity prediction tool based on a GNN). Immuno-GNN shows improved performance compared with known methods and also represents the first application of GNN model in neoantigen immunogenicity prediction. The construction of Neodb will facilitate the study of neoantigen immunogenicity and the clinical application of neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy.

"36200469","Building a 'Virtual Library': continuing a global collaboration to strengthen research capacity within Nepal and other low- and middle-income countries. To fill the gap in health research capacity-building efforts, we created the 'Virtual Library' (VL) - a web-based repository of context-relevant resources for health researchers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper describes the participatory process used to systematically develop the VL, and describes how our interprofessional team - representing both an LMIC (Nepal) and a high-income country (HIC) (USA, US) - engaged in shared meaning-making. A team of researchers and clinicians representing a range of subdisciplines from Nepal and the US created a replicable search strategy and standardized Resource Screening Guide (RSG) to systematically assess resources to be included within the VL. Descriptive methods were used to summarize findings from the RSG and lessons learned from the collaborative process.

More than 76% of resources met each of the four quality criteria (relevant; reputable, accessible; understandable). Within the published VL, 298 resources were included, organized by 15 topics and 45 sub-topics. Of these, 223 resources were evaluated by the RSG; 75 were identified by team member expertise. The collaborative process involved regular meetings, iterative document revisions, and peer review. Resource quality was better than expected, perhaps because best practices/principles related to health research are universally relevant, regardless of context. While the RSG was essential to systematize our search and ensure reproducibility, team member expertise was valuable. Pairing team members during peer-review led to bi-directional knowledge sharing and was particularly successful. This work reflects a highly collaborative global partnership and offers a model for future health research capacity-building efforts.

"35181599","pSATdb: a database of mitochondrial common, polymorphic, and unique microsatellites. Microsatellites, also termed as simple sequence repeats, are repetitive tracts in a DNA sequence, typically consisting of one to six nucleotides. These repeats are found in all genomes and play key roles in phylogeny and species identification. Microsatellites are highly polymorphic, and their length may differ from species to species. There are several online resources dedicated to mitochondria; however, comprehensive information is not available about the length variation of mitochondrial microsatellites. Therefore, to explore it between species among a genus, we have developed a database named pSATdb (polymorphic microSATellites database; https://lms.snu.edu.in/pSATdb/). pSATdb contains 28,710 perfect microsatellites identified across 5,976 mitochondrial genome (mt-genome) sequences from 1,576 genera which includes 1,535 (5,846 mt-genome) and 41 (130 mt-genome) genera of Metazoa and Viridiplantae, respectively. pSATdb is the only database which provides genus-wise information about the length variation of mitochondrial microsatellites. Because of the emerging role of microsatellites in genomics studies, the identified common, polymorphic, and unique microsatellites stored in pSATdb will be effectively useful in various studies including genetic diversity, mapping, marker-assisted selection, and comparative population studies.","2/18/2022","http://lms.snu.edu.in/pSATdb","pSATdb",0.996476412,"polymorphic microSATellites database",0.949501442909241,"pSATdb",0.9964764118,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36222201","KinMod database: a tool for investigating metabolic regulation. The ability of current kinetic models to simulate the phenotypic behaviour of cells is limited since cell metabolism is regulated at different levels including enzyme regulation. The small molecule regulation network (SMRN) enables cells to respond rapidly to environmental fluctuations by controlling the activity of enzymes in metabolic pathways. However, SMRN is not as well studied relative to metabolic networks. The main contributor to the lack of knowledge on this regulatory system is the sparsity of experimental data and the absence of a standard framework for representing available information. In this paper, we introduce the KinMod database that encompasses more than 2 million data points on the metabolism and metabolic regulation network of 9814 organisms KinMod database employs a hierarchical data structure to: (i) signify relationships between kinetic information obtained through in-vitro experiments and proteins, with an emphasis on SMRN, (ii) provide a thorough insight into available kinetic parameters and missing experimental measurements of this regulatory network and (iii) facilitate machine learning approaches for parameter estimation and accurate kinetic model construction by providing a homogeneous list of linked omics data. The hierarchical ontology of the KinMod database allows flexible exploration of data attributes and investigation of metabolic relationships within- and cross-species. Identifying missing experimental values suggests additional experiments required for kinetic parameter estimation. Linking multi-omics data and providing data on SMRN encourages the development of novel machine learning techniques for predicting missing kinetic parameters and promotes accurate kinetic model construction of cells metabolism by providing a comprehensive list of available kinetic measurements. To illustrate the value of KinMod data, we develop six analyses to visualize associations between data classes belonging to separate sections of the metabolism. Through these analyses, we demonstrate that the KinMod database provides a unique framework for biologists and engineers to retrieve, evaluate and compare the functional metabolism of species, including the regulatory network, and discover the extent of available and missing experimental values of the metabolic regulation.

MicroRNA childhood Cancer Catalog (M3Cs) is a high-quality curated collection of published miRNA research studies on 16 pediatric cancer diseases. M3Cs scope was based on two approaches: data-driven clinical significance and data-driven human pediatric cell line models. Based on the translational bioinformatics spectrum, the main objective of this study is to bring miRNA research into clinical significance in both pediatric cancer patient care and drug discovery toward health informatics in childhood cancer. M3Cs development passed through three phases: 1. Literature Mining: It includes external database search and screening. 2. Data processing that includes three steps: (a) Data Extraction, (b) Data Curation and annotation, (c) Web Development. 3. Publishing: Shinyapps.io was used as a web interface for the deployment of M3Cs. M3Cs is now available online and can be accessed through https://m3cs.shinyapps.io/M3Cs/. For data-driven clinical significance approach, 538 miRNAs from 268 publications were reported in the clinical domain while 7 miRNAs from 5 publications were reported in the clinical & drug domain. For data-driven human pediatric cell line models approach, 538 miRNAs from 1268 publications were reported in the cell line domain while 211 miRNAs from 177 publications in the cell line & drug domain. M3Cs acted to fill the gap by applying translational bioinformatics general pathway to transfer data-driven research toward data-driven clinical care and/or hypothesis generation. Aggregated and well-curated data of M3Cs will enable stakeholders in health care to incorporate miRNA in the clinical policy.

"37953774","Dex-Benchmark: datasets and code to evaluate algorithms for transcriptomics data analysis. Many tools and algorithms are available for analyzing transcriptomics data. These include algorithms for performing sequence alignment, data normalization and imputation, clustering, identifying differentially expressed genes, and performing gene set enrichment analysis. To make the best choice about which tools to use, objective benchmarks can be developed to compare the quality of different algorithms to extract biological knowledge maximally and accurately from these data. The Dexamethasone Benchmark (Dex-Benchmark) resource aims to fill this need by providing the community with datasets and code templates for benchmarking different gene expression analysis tools and algorithms. The resource provides access to a collection of curated RNA-seq, L1000, and ChIP-seq data from dexamethasone treatment as well as genetic perturbations of its known targets. In addition, the website provides Jupyter Notebooks that use these pre-processed curated datasets to demonstrate how to benchmark the different steps in gene expression analysis. By comparing two independent data sources and data types with some expected concordance, we can assess which tools and algorithms best recover such associations. To demonstrate the usefulness of the resource for discovering novel drug targets, we applied it to optimize data processing strategies for the chemical perturbations and CRISPR single gene knockouts from the L1000 transcriptomics data from the Library of Integrated Network Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program, with a focus on understudied proteins from the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program.

As an important nut crop species, macadamia continues to gain increased amounts of attention worldwide. Nevertheless, with the vast increase in macadamia omic data, it is becoming difficult for researchers to effectively process and utilize the information. In this work, we developed the first integrated germplasm and genomic database for macadamia (MacadamiaGGD), which includes five genomes of four species; three chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes; genome annotations; transcriptomic data for three macadamia varieties, germplasm data for four species and 262 main varieties; nine genetic linkage maps; and 35 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The database serves as a valuable collection of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, including both markers that are based on macadamia genomic sequences and developed in this study and markers developed previously. MacadamiaGGD is also integrated with multiple bioinformatic tools, such as search, JBrowse, BLAST, primer designer, sequence fetch, enrichment analysis, multiple sequence alignment, genome alignment, and gene homology annotation, which allows users to conveniently analyze their data of interest. MacadamiaGGD is freely available online (http://MacadamiaGGD.net). We believe that the database and additional information of the SSR markers can help scientists better understand the genomic sequence information of macadamia and further facilitate molecular breeding efforts of this species.","10/27/2022","http://macadamiaggd.net","MacadamiaGGD",0.984882891178131,"Macadamia germplasm and genomic database",0.928516063,"MacadamiaGGD",0.984882891,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

To assist non-specialists with the reuse of ECM proteomic datasets, we released MatrisomeDB (https://matrisomedb.org) in 2020. Here, we report the expansion of the database to include 25 new curated studies on the ECM of 24 new tissues in addition to datasets on tissues previously included, more than doubling the size of the original database and achieving near-complete coverage of the in-silico predicted matrisome. We further enhanced data visualization by maps of peptides and post-translational-modifications detected onto domain-based representations and 3D structures of ECM proteins. We also referenced external resources to facilitate the design of targeted mass spectrometry assays. Last, we implemented an abstract-mining tool that generates an enrichment word cloud from abstracts of studies in which a queried protein is found with higher confidence and higher abundance relative to other studies in MatrisomeDB.","1/1/2023","http://matrisomedb.org","MatrisomeDB",0.997348487377167,"",0,"MatrisomeDB",0.997348487,1,"","31586405","","","","merge all ""dup name"" IDs","",NA,""

Its primary aim is to promote the reusability of human-associated metagenomic data and assist with the identification of disease-associated microbes by consistently annotating the microbial contents of collected samples using state-of-the-art toolsets and manually curating the meta-data of corresponding human hosts. mBodyMap organizes collected samples based on their association with human diseases and body sites to enable cross-dataset integration and comparison. To help users find microbes of interest and visualize and compare their distributions and abundances/prevalence within different body sites and various diseases, the mBodyMap database is equipped with an intuitive interface and extensive graphical representations of the collected data. So far, it contains a total of 63 148 runs, including 14 401 metagenomes and 48 747 amplicons related to health and 56 human diseases, from within 22 human body sites across 136 projects.

"37925500","MCF2Chem: A manually curated knowledge base of biosynthetic compound production. Background Microbes have been used as cell factories to synthesize various chemical compounds. Recent advances in synthetic biological technologies have accelerated the increase in the number and capacity of microbial cell factories; the variety and number of synthetic compounds produced via these cell factories have also grown substantially. However, no database is available that provides detailed information on the microbial cell factories and the synthesized compounds. Results In this study, we established MCF2Chem, a manually curated knowledge base on the production of biosynthetic compounds using microbial cell factories. It contains 8888 items of production records related to 1231 compounds that were synthesizable by 590 microbial cell factories, including the production data of compounds (titer, yield, productivity, and content), strain culture information (culture medium, carbon source/precursor/substrate), fermentation information (mode, vessel, scale, and condition), and other information (e.g., strain modification method). The database contains statistical analyses data of compounds and microbial species. The data statistics of MCF2Chem showed that bacteria accounted for 60% of the species and that ""fatty acids"", ""terpenoids"", and ""shikimates and phenylpropanoids"" accounted for the top three chemical products. Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Corynebacterium glutamicum synthesized 78% of these chemical compounds. Furthermore, we constructed a system to recommend microbial cell factories suitable for synthesizing target compounds and vice versa by combining MCF2Chem data, additional strain- and compound-related data, the phylogenetic relationships between strains, and compound similarities. Conclusions MCF2Chem provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing, and visualizing detailed statistical information on microbial cell factories and their synthesizable compounds. It is publicly available at https://mcf.lifesynther.com .

"34918130","Development of RIKEN Plant Metabolome MetaDatabase. The advancement of metabolomics in terms of techniques for measuring small molecules has enabled the rapid detection and quantification of numerous cellular metabolites. Metabolomic data provide new opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of plant metabolism that can improve the health of both plants and humans that consume them. Although major public repositories for general metabolomic data have been established, the community still has shortcomings related to data sharing, especially in terms of data reanalysis, reusability and reproducibility. To address these issues, we developed the RIKEN Plant Metabolome MetaDatabase (RIKEN PMM, http://metabobank.riken.jp/pmm/db/plantMetabolomics), which stores mass spectrometry-based (e.g. gas chromatography-MS-based) metabolite profiling data of plants together with their detailed, structured experimental metadata, including sampling and experimental procedures. Our metadata are described as Linked Open Data based on the Resource Description Framework using standardized and controlled vocabularies, such as the Metabolomics Standards Initiative Ontology, which are to be integrated with various life and biomedical science data using the World Wide Web. RIKEN PMM implements intuitive and interactive operations for plant metabolome data, including raw data (netCDF format), mass spectra (NIST MSP format) and metabolite annotations. The feature is suitable not only for biologists who are interested in metabolomic phenotypes, but also for researchers who would like to investigate life science in general through plant metabolomic approaches.","3/1/2022","http://metabobank.riken.jp/pmm/db/plantMetabolomics","RIKEN PMM",0.912697517871857,"RIKEN Plant Metabolome MetaDatabase",0.881834341420068,"RIKEN PMM",0.912697518,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"36367311","MGTdb: a web service and database for studying the global and local genomic epidemiology of bacterial pathogens. Multilevel genome typing (MGT) enables the genomic characterization of bacterial isolates and the relationships among them. The MGT system describes an isolate using multiple multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes, referred to as levels. Thus, for a new isolate, sequence types (STs) assigned at multiple precisely defined levels can be used to type isolates at multiple resolutions. The MGT designation for isolates is stable, and the assignment is faster than the existing approaches. MGT's utility has been demonstrated in multiple species. This paper presents a publicly accessible web service called MGTdb, which enables the assignment of MGT STs to isolates, along with their storage, retrieval and analysis. The MGTdb web service enables upload of genome data as sequence reads or alleles, which are processed and assigned MGT identifiers. Additionally, any newly sequenced isolates deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Sequence Read Archive are also regularly retrieved (currently daily), processed, assigned MGT identifiers and made publicly available in MGTdb. Interactive visualization tools are presented to assist analysis, along with capabilities to download publicly available isolates and assignments for use with external software. MGTdb is currently available for Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis and Vibrio cholerae. We demonstrate the usability of MGTdb through three case studies - to study the long-term national surveillance of S. Typhimurium, the local epidemiology and outbreaks of S. Typhimurium, and the global epidemiology of V. cholerae. Thus, MGTdb enables epidemiological and microbiological investigations at multiple levels of resolution for all publicly available isolates of these pathogens.

"36318236","The MHC Motif Atlas: a database of MHC binding specificities and ligands. The highly polymorphic Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes are responsible for the binding and cell surface presentation of pathogen or cancer specific T-cell epitopes. This process is fundamental for eliciting T-cell recognition of infected or malignant cells. Epitopes displayed on MHC molecules further provide therapeutic targets for personalized cancer vaccines or adoptive T-cell therapy. To help visualizing, analyzing and comparing the different binding specificities of MHC molecules, we developed the MHC Motif Atlas (http://mhcmotifatlas.org/). This database contains information about thousands of class I and class II MHC molecules, including binding motifs, peptide length distributions, motifs of phosphorylated ligands, multiple specificities or links to X-ray crystallography structures. The database further enables users to download curated datasets of MHC ligands. By combining intuitive visualization of the main binding properties of MHC molecules together with access to more than a million ligands, the MHC Motif Atlas provides a central resource to analyze and interpret the binding specificities of MHC molecules.","1/1/2023","http://mhcmotifatlas.org","MHC Motif",0.689360126852989,"MHC Motif Atlas",0.508573710918427,"MHC Motif",0.689360127,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""
"35664224","MIAOME: Human microbiome affect the host epigenome. Besides the genetic factors having tremendous influences on the regulations of the epigenome, the microenvironmental factors have recently gained extensive attention for their roles in affecting the host epigenome. There are three major types of microenvironmental factors: microbiota-derived metabolites (MDM), microbiota-derived components (MDC) and microbiota-secreted proteins (MSP). These factors can regulate host physiology by modifying host gene expression through the three highly interconnected epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. histone modifications, DNA modifications, and non-coding RNAs). However, no database was available to provide the comprehensive factors of these types. Herein, a database entitled 'Human Microbiome Affect The Host Epigenome (MIAOME)' was constructed. Based on the types of epigenetic modifications confirmed in the literature review, the MIAOME database captures 1068 (63 genus, 281 species, 707 strains, etc.) human microbes, 91 unique microbiota-derived metabolites & components (16 fatty acids, 10 bile acids, 10 phenolic compounds, 10 vitamins, 9 tryptophan metabolites, etc.) derived from 967 microbes; 50 microbes that secreted 40 proteins; 98 microbes that directly influence the host epigenetic modification, and provides 3 classifications of the epigenome, including (1) 4 types of DNA modifications, (2) 20 histone modifications and (3) 490 ncRNAs regulations, involved in 160 human diseases. All in all, MIAOME has compiled the information on the microenvironmental factors influence host epigenome through the scientific literature and biochemical databases, and allows the collective considerations among the different types of factors.

"36399496, 31612915","MIBiG 3.0: a community-driven effort to annotate experimentally validated biosynthetic gene clusters. With an ever-increasing amount of (meta)genomic data being deposited in sequence databases, (meta)genome mining for natural product biosynthetic pathways occupies a critical role in the discovery of novel pharmaceutical drugs, crop protection agents and biomaterials. The genes that encode these pathways are often organised into biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). In 2015, we defined the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG): a standardised data format that describes the minimally required information to uniquely characterise a BGC. We simultaneously constructed an accompanying online database of BGCs, which has since been widely used by the community as a reference dataset for BGCs and was expanded to 2021 entries in 2019 (MIBiG 2.0). Here, we describe MIBiG 3.0, a database update comprising large-scale validation and re-annotation of existing entries and 661 new entries. Particular attention was paid to the annotation of compound structures and biological activities, as well as protein domain selectivities. Together, these new features keep the database up-to-date, and will provide new opportunities for the scientific community to use its freely available data, e.g. for the training of new machine learning models to predict sequence-structure-function relationships for diverse natural products.

"38867901","mibPOPdb: An online database for microbial biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants. Microbial biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is an attractive, ecofriendly, and cost-efficient clean-up technique for reclaiming POP-contaminated environments. In the last few decades, the number of publications documenting POP-degrading microbes, enzymes, and experimental data sets has continuously increased, necessitating the development of a dedicated web resource that catalogs consolidated information on POP-degrading microbes and tools to facilitate integrative analysis of POP degradation data sets. To address this knowledge gap, we developed the Microbial Biodegradation of Persistent Organic Pollutants Database (mibPOPdb) by accumulating microbial POP degradation information from the public domain and manually curating published scientific literature. Currently, in mibPOPdb, there are 9215 microbial strain entries, including 184 gene (sub)families, 100 enzymes, 48 biodegradation pathways, and 593 intermediate compounds identified in POP-biodegradation processes, and information on 32 toxic compounds listed under the Stockholm Convention environmental treaty. Besides the standard database functionalities, which include data searching, browsing, and retrieval of database entries, we provide a suite of bioinformatics services to facilitate comparative analysis of users' own data sets against mibPOPdb entries.

"37530223","Milletdb: a multi-omics database to accelerate the research of functional genomics and molecular breeding of millets. Millets are a class of nutrient-rich coarse cereals with high resistance to abiotic stress; thus, they guarantee food security for people living in areas with extreme climatic conditions and provide stress-related genetic resources for other crops. However, no platform is available to provide a comprehensive and systematic multi-omics analysis for millets, which seriously hinders the mining of stress-related genes and the molecular breeding of millets. Here, a free, web-accessible, user-friendly millets multi-omics database platform (Milletdb, http://milletdb.novogene.com) has been developed. The Milletdb contains six millets and their one related species genomes, graph-based pan-genomics of pearl millet, and stress-related multi-omics data, which enable Milletdb to be the most complete millets multi-omics database available.

Milletdb can simplify the functional genomics analysis of millets by providing users with 20 different tools (e.g., 'Gene mapping', 'Co-expression', 'KEGG/GO Enrichment' analysis, etc.). On the Milletdb platform, a gene PMA1G03779.1 was identified through 'GWAS', which has the potential to modulate yield and respond to different environmental stresses. Using the tools provided by Milletdb, we found that the stress-related PLATZs TFs (transcription factors) family expands in 87.5% of millet accessions and contributes to vegetative growth and abiotic stress responses. Milletdb can effectively serve researchers in the mining of key genes, genome editing and molecular breeding of millets.","8/2/2023","http://milletdb.novogene.com","Milletdb",0.996221780776978,"",0,"Milletdb",0.996221781,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

MiMeDB was established to consolidate the growing body of data connecting the human microbiome and the chemicals it produces to both health and disease. MiMeDB contains detailed taxonomic, microbiological and body-site location data on most known human microbes (bacteria and fungi). This microbial data is linked to extensive genomic and proteomic sequence data that is closely coupled to colourful interactive chromosomal maps. The database also houses detailed information about all the known metabolites generated by these microbes, their structural, chemical and spectral properties, the reactions and enzymes responsible for these metabolites and the primary exposome sources (food, drug, cosmetic, pollutant, etc.) that ultimately lead to the observed microbial metabolites in humans. Additional, extensively referenced data about the known or presumptive health effects, measured biosample concentrations and human protein targets for these compounds is provided. All of this information is housed in richly annotated, highly interactive, visually pleasing database that has been designed to be easy to search, easy to browse and easy to navigate. Currently MiMeDB contains data on 626 health effects or bioactivities, 1904 microbes, 3112 references, 22 054 reactions, 24 254 metabolites or exposure chemicals, 648 861 MS and NMR spectra, 6.4 million genes and 7.6 billion DNA bases.

To benchmark MIrROR, we compared performance against publicly available databases and tool with mock communities and simulated data sets. Our platform showed promising results in terms of the number of species covered and the accuracy of classification. To encourage active 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon analysis in the field, BLAST function and taxonomic profiling results with 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon studies, which have been reported as BioProject on NCBI are provided. MIrROR (http://mirror.egnome.co.kr/) will be a useful platform for researchers who want to perform high-resolution metagenome analysis with a cost-effective sequencer such as MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. IMPORTANCE Metabarcoding is a powerful tool to investigate community diversity in an economic and efficient way by amplifying a specific gene marker region. With the advancement of long-read sequencing technologies, the field of metabarcoding has entered a new phase. The technologies have brought a need for development in several areas, including new markers that long-read can cover, database for the markers, tools that reflect long-read characteristics, and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. By constructing MIrROR, we met the need for a database and tools for the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region, which has recently been shown to have sufficient resolution at the species level. Bacterial community analysis using the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region with MIrROR will provide new insights from various research fields.","3/30/2022","http://mirror.egnome.co.kr","MIrROR",0.996891975,"",0,"MIrROR",0.9968919754,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"34850920","miRTarBase update 2022: an informative resource for experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with 18-26 nucleotides; they pair with target mRNAs to regulate gene expression and produce significant changes in various physiological and pathological processes. In recent years, the interaction between miRNAs and their target genes has become one of the mainstream directions for drug development. As a large-scale biological database that mainly provides miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) verified by biological experiments, miRTarBase has undergone five revisions and enhancements.

Mr.Vc is a database of curated Vibrio cholerae transcriptome data and annotated information. The main objective is to facilitate the accessibility and reusability of the rapidly growing Vibrio cholerae omics data and relevant annotation. To achieve these goals, we performed manual curation on the transcriptome data and organized the datasets in an experiment-centric manner. We collected unknown operons annotated through text-mining analysis that would provide more clues about how Vibrio cholerae modulates gene regulation. Meanwhile, to understand the relationship between genes or experiments, we performed gene co-expression analysis and experiment-experiment correlation analysis. In additional, functional module named ""Interactions"" which dedicates to collecting experimentally validated interactions about Vibrio cholerae from public databases, MEDLINE documents and literature in life science journals.

"34850956","msRepDB: a comprehensive repetitive sequence database of over 80 000 species. Repeats are prevalent in the genomes of all bacteria, plants and animals, and they cover nearly half of the Human genome, which play indispensable roles in the evolution, inheritance, variation and genomic instability, and serve as substrates for chromosomal rearrangements that include disease-causing deletions, inversions, and translocations. Comprehensive identification, classification and annotation of repeats in genomes can provide accurate and targeted solutions towards understanding and diagnosis of complex diseases, optimization of plant properties and development of new drugs. RepBase and Dfam are two most frequently used repeat databases, but they are not sufficiently complete. Due to the lack of a comprehensive repeat database of multiple species, the current research in this field is far from being satisfactory. LongRepMarker is a new framework developed recently by our group for comprehensive identification of genomic repeats. We here propose msRepDB based on LongRepMarker, which is currently the most comprehensive multi-species repeat database, covering >80 000 species. Comprehensive evaluations show that msRepDB contains more species, and more complete repeats and families than RepBase and Dfam databases.

"36330927, 31598699","QTLbase2: an enhanced catalog of human quantitative trait loci on extensive molecular phenotypes. Deciphering the fine-scale molecular mechanisms that shape the genetic effects at disease-associated loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remains challenging. The key avenue is to identify the essential molecular phenotypes that mediate the causal variant and disease under particular biological conditions. Therefore, integrating GWAS signals with context-specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs) (such as different tissue/cell types, disease states, and perturbations) from extensive molecular phenotypes would present important strategies for full understanding of disease genetics. Via persistent curation and systematic data processing of large-scale human molecular trait QTLs (xQTLs), we updated our previous QTLbase database (now QTLbase2, http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase) to comprehensively analyze and visualize context-specific QTLs across 22 molecular phenotypes and over 95 tissue/cell types. Overall, the resource features the following major updates and novel functions: (i) 960 more genome-wide QTL summary statistics from 146 independent studies; (ii) new data for 10 previously uncompiled QTL types; (iii) variant query scope expanded to fit 195 QTL datasets based on whole-genome sequencing; (iv) supports filtering and comparison of QTLs for different biological conditions, such as stimulation types and disease states; (v) a new linkage disequilibrium viewer to facilitate variant prioritization across tissue/cell types and QTL types.","1/1/2023","http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase","QTLbase",0.997860312,"",0,"QTLbase",0.997860312,2,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Virus infections are huge threats to living organisms and cause many diseases, such as COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has led to millions of deaths. To develop effective strategies to control viral infection, we need to understand its molecular events in host cells. Virus related functional genomic datasets are growing rapidly, however, an integrative platform for systematically investigating host responses to viruses is missing. Here, we developed a user-friendly multi-omics portal of viral infection named as MVIP (https://mvip.whu.edu.cn/). We manually collected available high-throughput sequencing data under viral infection, and unified their detailed metadata including virus, host species, infection time, assay, and target, etc. We processed multi-layered omics data of more than 4900 viral infected samples from 77 viruses and 33 host species with standard pipelines, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and CLIP-seq, etc. In addition, we integrated these genome-wide signals into customized genome browsers, and developed√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†multiple dynamic charts to exhibit√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†the information, such as time-course dynamic and differential gene expression profiles, alternative splicing changes√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†and enriched GO/KEGG terms.

Accordingly, M. pneumoniae has become a model organism for systems biology in the past decade. To support the investigation of the components of this minimal bacterium, we have generated the database MycoWiki. (http://mycowiki.uni-goettingen.de) MycoWiki organizes data under a relational database and provides access to curated and state-of-the-art information on the genes and proteins of M. pneumoniae. Interestingly, M. pneumoniae has undergone an evolution that resulted in the limited similarity of many proteins to proteins of model organisms. To facilitate the analysis of the functions of M. pneumoniae proteins, we have integrated structure predictions from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database for most proteins, structural information resulting from in vivo cross-linking, and protein-protein interactions based on a global in vivo study.

"37093842","MTSviewer: A database to visualize mitochondrial targeting sequences, cleavage sites, and mutations on protein structures. Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in a wide array of human diseases ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to cardiovascular defects. The coordinated localization and import of proteins into mitochondria are essential processes that ensure mitochondrial homeostasis. The localization and import of most mitochondrial proteins are driven by N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS's), which interact with import machinery and are removed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). The recent discovery of internal MTS's-those which are distributed throughout a protein and act as import regulators or secondary MPP cleavage sites-has expanded the role of both MTS's and MPP beyond conventional N-terminal regulatory pathways. Still, the global mutational landscape of MTS's remains poorly characterized, both from genetic and structural perspectives. To this end, we have integrated a variety of tools into one harmonized R/Shiny database called MTSviewer (https://neurobioinfo.github.io/MTSvieweR/), which combines MTS predictions, cleavage sites, genetic variants, pathogenicity predictions, and N-terminomics data with structural visualization using AlphaFold models of human and yeast mitochondrial proteomes.

"36795011","Systematic Description of the Content Variation of Natural Products (NPs): To Prompt the Yield of High-Value NPs and the Discovery of New Therapeutics. Natural products (NPs) have long been associated with human production and play a key role in the survival of species. Significant variations in NP content may severely affect the ""return on investment"" of NP-based industries and render ecological systems vulnerable. Thus, it is crucial to construct a platform that relates variations in NP content to their corresponding mechanisms. In this study, a publicly accessible online platform, NPcVar (http://npcvar.idrblab.net/), was developed, which systematically described the variations of NP contents and their corresponding mechanisms. The platform comprises 2201 NPs and 694 biological resources, including plants, bacteria, and fungi, curated using 126 diverse factors with 26,425 records. Each record contains information about the species, NP, and factors involved, as well as NP content data, parts of the plant that produce NPs, the location of the experiment, and reference information. All factors were manually curated and categorized into 42 classes which belong to four mechanisms (molecular regulation, species factor, environmental condition, and combined factor). Additionally, the cross-links of species and NP to well-established databases and the visualization of NP content under various experimental conditions were provided. In conclusion, NPcVar is a valuable resource for understanding the relationship between species, factors, and NP contents and is anticipated to serve as a promising tool for improving the yield of high-value NPs and facilitating the development of new therapeutics.","2/16/2023","http://npcvar.idrblab.net","NPcVar",0.996837973594666,"",0,"NPcVar",0.996837974,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36394419","OakRootRNADB-a consolidated RNA-seq database for coding and noncoding RNA in roots of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). The degree to which roots elongate is determined by the expression of genes that regulate root growth in each developmental zone of a root. Most studies have, however, focused on the molecular factors that regulate primary root growth in annual plants. In contrast, the relationship between gene expression and a specific pattern of taproot development and growth in trees is poorly understood. However, the presence of a deeply located taproot, with branching lateral roots, can especially mitigate the effect of insufficient water availability in long-lived trees, such as pedunculated oak. In the present article, we integrated the ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing data on roots of oak trees into a single comprehensive database, named OakRootRNADB that contains information on both coding and noncoding RNAs. The sequences in the database also enclose information pertaining to transcription factors, transcriptional regulators and chromatin regulators, as well as a prediction of the cellular localization of a transcript. OakRootRNADB has a user-friendly interface and functional tools that increase access to genomic information. Integrated knowledge of molecular patterns of expression, specifically occurring within and between root zones and within root types, can elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating taproot growth and enhanced root soil exploration.

"36699350","ODEbase: a repository of ODE systems for systems biology. Summary Recently, symbolic computation and computer algebra systems have been successfully applied in systems biology, especially in chemical reaction network theory. One advantage of symbolic computation is its potential for qualitative answers to biological questions. Qualitative methods analyze dynamical input systems as formal objects, in contrast to investigating only part of the state space, as is the case with numerical simulation. However, corresponding tools and libraries have a different set of requirements for their input data than their numerical counterparts. A common format used in mathematical modeling of biological processes is Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). We illustrate that the use of SBML data in symbolic computation requires significant pre-processing, incorporating external biological and mathematical expertise.

"35411390","Scaling up oligogenic diseases research with OLIDA: the Oligogenic Diseases Database. Improving the understanding of the oligogenic nature of diseases requires access to high-quality, well-curated Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data. Although first steps were taken with the development of the Digenic Diseases Database, leading to novel computational advancements to assist the field, these were also linked with a number of limitations, for instance, the ad hoc curation protocol and the inclusion of only digenic cases. The OLIgogenic diseases DAtabase (OLIDA) presents a novel, transparent and rigorous curation protocol, introducing a confidence scoring mechanism for the published oligogenic literature. The application of this protocol on the oligogenic literature generated a new repository containing 916 oligogenic variant combinations linked to 159 distinct diseases. Information extracted from the scientific literature is supplemented with current knowledge support obtained from public databases. Each entry is an oligogenic combination linked to a disease, labelled with a confidence score based on the level of genetic and functional evidence that supports its involvement in this disease. These scores allow users to assess the relevance and proof of pathogenicity of each oligogenic combination in the database, constituting markers for reporting improvements on disease-causing oligogenic variant combinations. OLIDA follows the FAIR principles, providing detailed documentation, easy data access through its application programming interface and website, use of unique identifiers and links to existing ontologies.

"37995323","IPOP: An Integrative Plant Multi-omics Platform for Cross-species Comparison and Evolutionary Study. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to the production of a significant amount of omics data in plants, which serves as valuable assets for conducting cross-species multi-omics comparative analysis. Nevertheless, the current dearth of comprehensive platforms providing evolutionary annotation information and multi-species multi-omics data impedes users from systematically and efficiently performing evolutionary and functional analysis on specific genes. In order to establish an advanced plant multi-omics platform that provides timely, accurate, and high-caliber omics information, we collected 7 distinct types of omics data from 6 monocots, 6 dicots, and 1 moss, and reanalyzed these data using standardized pipelines. Additionally, we furnished homology information, duplication events, and phylostratigraphic stages of 13 species to facilitate evolutionary examination. Furthermore, the integrative plant omics platform (IPOP) is bundled with a variety of online analysis tools that aid users in conducting evolutionary and functional analysis. Specifically, the Multi-omics Integration Analysis tool is available to consolidate information from diverse omics sources, while the Transcriptome-wide Association Analysis tool facilitates the linkage of functional analysis with phenotype. To illustrate the application of IPOP, we conducted a case study on the YTH domain gene family, wherein we observed shared functionalities within orthologous groups and discerned variations in evolutionary patterns across these groups. To summarize, the IPOP platform offers valuable evolutionary insights and multi-omics data to the plant sciences community, effectively addressing the need for cross-species comparison and evolutionary research platforms.

"34718715","OncoDB: an interactive online database for analysis of gene expression and viral infection in cancer. Large-scale multi-omics datasets, most prominently from the TCGA consortium, have been made available to the public for systematic characterization of human cancers. However, to date, there is a lack of corresponding online resources to utilize these valuable data to study gene expression dysregulation and viral infection, two major causes for cancer development and progression. To address these unmet needs, we established OncoDB, an online database resource to explore abnormal patterns in gene expression as well as viral infection that are correlated to clinical features in cancer. Specifically, OncoDB integrated RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and related clinical data from over 10 000 cancer patients in the TCGA study as well as from normal tissues in the GTEx study. Another unique aspect of OncoDB is its focus on oncoviruses. By mining TCGA RNA-seq data, we have identified six major oncoviruses across cancer types and further correlated viral infection to changes in host gene expression and clinical outcomes. All the analysis results are integratively presented in OncoDB with a flexible web interface to search for data related to RNA expression, DNA methylation, viral infection, and clinical features of the cancer patients.

"35446896","Sharing datasets of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic. At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing access to data (properly optimised regarding personal data protection) plays a crucial role in providing the general public and media with up-to-date information. Open datasets also represent one of the means for evaluation of the pandemic on a global level. The primary aim of this paper is to describe the methodological and technical framework for publishing datasets describing characteristics related to the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic (epidemiology, hospital-based care, vaccination), including the use of these datasets in practice. Practical aspects and experience with data sharing are discussed. As a reaction to the epidemic situation, a new portal COVID-19: Current Situation in the Czech Republic (https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19) was developed and launched in March 2020 to provide a fully-fledged and trustworthy source of information for the public and media. The portal also contains a section for the publication of (i) public open datasets available for download in CSV and JSON formats and (ii) authorised-access-only section where the authorised persons can (through an online generated token) safely visualise or download regional datasets with aggregated data at the level of the individual municipalities and regions. The data are also provided to the local open data catalogue (covering only open data on healthcare, provided by the Ministry of Health) and to the National Catalogue of Open Data (covering all open data sets, provided by various authorities/publishers, and harversting all data from local catalogues). The datasets have been published in various authentication regimes and widely used by general public, scientists, public authorities and decision-makers. The total number of API calls since its launch in March 2020 to 15 December 2020 exceeded 13 million. The datasets have been adopted as an official and guaranteed source for outputs of third parties, including public authorities, non-governmental organisations, scientists and online news portals. Datasets currently published as open data meet the 3-star open data requirements, which makes them machine-readable and facilitates their further usage without restrictions. This is essential for making the data more easily understandable and usable for data consumers. In conjunction with the strategy of the MH in the field of data opening, additional datasets meeting the already implemented standards will be also released, both on COVID-19 related and unrelated topics.","4/21/2022","http://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19","COVID-1",0.850735425949097,"",0,"COVID-1",0.850735426,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","remove","","","FALSE POS: PARTIAL NAME",NA,""

Accurate intraoperative diagnosis is essential for providing safe and effective care during brain tumor surgery. Our standard-of-care diagnostic methods are time, resource, and labor intensive, which restricts access to optimal surgical treatments. To address these limitations, we propose an alternative workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH), a rapid optical imaging method, with deep learning-based automated interpretation of SRH images for intraoperative brain tumor diagnosis and real-time surgical decision support. Here, we present OpenSRH, the first public dataset of clinical SRH images from 300+ brain tumors patients and 1300+ unique whole slide optical images. OpenSRH contains data from the most common brain tumors diagnoses, full pathologic annotations, whole slide tumor segmentations, raw and processed optical imaging data for end-to-end model development and validation. We provide a framework for patch-based whole slide SRH classification and inference using weak (i.e. patient-level) diagnostic labels. Finally, we benchmark two computer vision tasks: multiclass histologic brain tumor classification and patch-based contrastive representation learning. We hope OpenSRH will facilitate the clinical translation of rapid optical imaging and real-time ML-based surgical decision support in order to improve the access, safety, and efficacy of cancer surgery in the era of precision medicine.

Improved bioassays have significantly increased the rate of identifying new protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and the number of detected human PPIs has greatly exceeded early estimates of human interactome size. These new PPIs provide a more complete view of disease mechanisms but precise understanding of how PPIs affect phenotype remains a challenge. It requires knowledge of PPI context (e.g.√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†tissues, subcellular localizations), and functional roles, especially within pathways and protein complexes. The previous IID release focused on PPI context, providing networks with comprehensive tissue, disease, cellular localization, and druggability annotations. The current update adds developmental stages to the available contexts, and provides a way of assigning context to PPIs that could not be previously annotated due to insufficient data or incompatibility with available context categories (e.g.√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†interactions between membrane and cytoplasmic proteins). This update also annotates PPIs with conservation across species, directionality in pathways, membership in large complexes, interaction stability (i.e.√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†stable or transient), and mutation effects.

"36474475","Osteoarthritis Data Integration Portal (OsteoDIP): A web-based gene and non-coding RNA expression database. Objective OsteoDIP aims to collect and provide, in a simple searchable format, curated high throughput RNA expression data related to osteoarthritis. Design Datasets are collected annually by searching ""osteoarthritis gene expression profile"" in PubMed. Only publications containing patient data and a list of differentially expressed genes are considered. From 2020, the search has expanded to include non-coding RNAs. Moreover, a search in GEO for ""osteoarthritis"" datasets has been performed using 'Homo sapiens' and 'Expression profiling by array' filters. Annotations for genes linked to osteoarthritis have been downloaded from external databases. Results Out of 1204 curated papers, 63 have been included in OsteoDIP, while GEO curation led to the collection of 28 datasets. Literature data provides a snapshot of osteoarthritis research derived from 1924 human samples, while GEO datasets provide expression for additional 1012 patients. Similar to osteoarthritis literature, OsteoDIP data has been created mostly from studies focused on knee, and the tissue most frequently investigated is cartilage. GEO data sets were fully integrated with associated clinical data. We showcase examples and use cases applicable for translational research in osteoarthritis.

"37499897","INTERPIN: A repository for intrinsic transcription termination hairpins in bacteria. The large-scale detection of putative intrinsic transcription terminators is limited to only a few bacteria currently. We discovered a group of hairpins, called cluster hairpins, present within 15 nucleotides from each other. These are expected to work in tandem to cause intrinsic transcription termination (ITT), while the single hairpin can do the same alone. Therefore, exploring these ITT sites and the hairpins across bacterial genomes becomes highly desirable. INTERPIN is the largest archived collection of in silico inferred ITT hairpins in bacteria, covering 12745 bacterial genomes and encompassing ten bacterial phyla for √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬à√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬º25 million hairpins.

"35693187","PanaxGDB: A Comprehensive Platform for Panax. The genus Panax is a valuable natural medicinal source used worldwide that contains high levels of triterpenoid saponins with extensive pharmacological activities. In past decades, molecular biotechnology and breeding techniques have been respectively used to generate omics data and information on cultivars primarily from Panax ginseng (ginseng), Panax quinquefolium (American ginseng), and Panax notoginseng (Sanqi) to biosynthesize valuable saponins, improve product quality, and conduct cost-controlled cultivation. Although much data have been produced, there are concerns that redundant data might be generated and that relatively scattered data might be overlooked. Therefore, many scientists desire a reliable, comprehensive omics database of the Panax genus that could save time and promote integrated analysis. Therefore, to provide all-inclusive, reliable, and valuable information on the Panax genus, PanaxGDB, an open comprehensive database that integrates data on omics and information on varieties, was established. The database contains information on nearly 600 compounds from 12 Panax species, draft genomic sequences with annotations and gene expression levels, single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association analysis based on agronomic traits, globally collected germplasm information, summaries, omics data of the Panax genus, and online versatile analytic tools. The Panax genus database will be updated when new data are released to continue serving as a central portal to boost research on the biology and functions of Panax.

In the present paper, as part of an interdisciplinary research project (Priority Programme SPP2045), we propose a possible way to design an open access archive for particle-discrete tomographic datasets: the PARROT database (https://parrot.tu-freiberg.de). This archive is the result of a pilot study in the field of particle technology and three use cases are presented for illustrative purposes. Instead of providing a detailed instruction manual, we focus on the methodologies of such an archive. The presented use cases stem from our working group and are intended to demonstrate the advantage of using such an archive with concise and consistent data for potential and ongoing studies. Data and metadata merely serve as examples and need to be adapted for disciplines not concerned here.

"36207780","CTPC, a combined transcriptome data set of human prostate cancer cell lines. Background Cell lines are the most used model system in cancer research. The transcriptomic data of established prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines help researchers explore differential gene expressions across the various PCa cell lines. Methods Through large scale datamining, we established a curated Combined Transcriptome dataset of PCa Cell lines (CTPC) which contains the transcriptomic data of 1840 samples of 9 commonly used PCa cell lines including LNCaP, LNCaP-95, LNCaP-abl, C4-2, VCaP, 22Rv1, PC3, DU145, and NCI-H660. Results The CTPC dataset provides an opportunity for researchers to not only compare gene expression across different PCa cell lines but also retrieve the experiment information and associate the differential gene expression data with meta data, such as gene manipulation and drug treatment information. Additionally, based on the CTPC dataset, we built a platform for users to visualize the data (https://pcatools.shinyapps.io/CTPC_V2/).

It is a freely-accessible repository of validated protein circular dichroism (CD) spectra and associated sample and metadata, with entries having links to other bioinformatics resources including, amongst others, structure (PDB), AlphaFold, and sequence (UniProt) databases, as well as to published papers which produced the data and cite the database entries. It includes primary (unprocessed) and final (processed) spectral data, which are available in both text and pictorial formats, as well as detailed sample and validation information produced for each of the entries. Recently the metadata content associated with each of the entries, as well as the number and structural breadth of the protein components included, have been expanded. The PCDDB includes data on both wild-type and mutant proteins, and because CD studies primarily examine proteins in solution, it also contains examples of the effects of different environments on their structures, plus thermal unfolding/folding series. Methods for both sequence and spectral comparisons are included. The data included in the PCDDB complement results from crystal, cryo-electron microscopy, NMR spectroscopy, bioinformatics characterisations and classifications, and other structural information available for the proteins via links to other databases. The entries in the PCDDB have been used for the development of new analytical methodologies, for interpreting spectral and other biophysical data, and for providing insight into structures and functions of individual soluble and membrane proteins and protein complexes.","1/6/2022","http://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk","PCDDB",0.998229384,"Protein Circular Dichroism Data Bank",0.960739791,"PCDDB",0.998229384,2,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36598340","Classification of GBA1 Variants in Parkinson's Disease: The GBA1-PD Browser. Background GBA1 variants are among the most common genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). GBA1 variants can be classified into three categories based on their role in Gaucher's disease (GD) or PD: severe, mild, and risk variant (for PD). Objective This review aims to generate and share a comprehensive database for GBA1 variants reported in PD to support future research and clinical trials. Methods We performed a literature search for all GBA1 variants that have been reported in PD. The data have been standardized and complemented with variant classification, odds ratio if available, and other data. Results We found 371 GBA1 variants reported in PD: 22 mild, 84 severe, 3 risk variants, and 262 of unknown status. We created a browser containing up-to-date information on these variants (https://pdgenetics.shinyapps.io/GBA1Browser/). Conclusions The classification and browser presented in this work should inform and support basic, translational, and clinical research on GBA1-PD. √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬© 2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","1/4/2023","http://pdgenetics.shinyapps.io/GBA1Browser","GBA1-PD",0.739730442,"",0,"GBA1-PD",0.7397304416,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

Pear (Pyrus ssp.) belongs to Rosaceae and is an important fruit tree widely cultivated around the world. Currently, challenges to cope with the burgeoning sets of multiomics data are rapidly increasing. Here, we constructed the Pear Multiomics Database (PearMODB) by integrating genome, transcriptome, epigenome and population variation data, and aimed to provide a portal for accessing and analyzing pear multiomics data. A variety of online tools were built including gene search, BLAST, JBrowse, expression heatmap, synteny analysis and primer design. The information of DNA methylation sites and single-nucleotide polymorphisms can be retrieved through the custom JBrowse, providing an opportunity to explore the genetic polymorphisms linked to phenotype variation. Moreover, different gene families involving transcription factors, transcription regulators and disease resistance (nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat) were identified and compiled for quick search. In particular, biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were identified in pear genomes, and specialized webpages were set up to show detailed information of BGCs, laying a foundation for studying metabolic diversity among different pear varieties. Overall, PearMODB provides an important platform for pear genomics, genetics and breeding studies.

The scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced an abundance of publications, including peer-reviewed articles and preprints, across a wide array of disciplines, from microbiology to medicine and social sciences. Genomics and precision health (GPH) technologies have had a particularly prominent role in medical and public health investigations and response; however, these domains are not simply defined and it is difficult to search for relevant information using traditional strategies. To quantify and track the ongoing contributions of GPH to the COVID-19 response, the Office of Genomics and Precision Public Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created the COVID-19 Genomics and Precision Health database (COVID-19 GPH), an open access knowledge management system and publications database that is continuously updated through machine learning and manual curation. As of February 11, 2022, COVID-GPH contained 31,597 articles, mostly on pathogen and human genomics (72%). The database also includes articles describing applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence to the investigation and control of COVID-19 (28%). COVID-GPH represents about 10% (22983/221241) of the literature on COVID-19 on PubMed.

"35776535","PHILM2Web: A high-throughput database of macromolecular host-pathogen interactions on the Web. During infection, the pathogen's entry into the host organism, breaching the host immune defense, spread and multiplication are frequently mediated by multiple interactions between the host and pathogen proteins. Systematic studying of host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) is a challenging task for both experimental and computational approaches and is critically dependent on the previously obtained knowledge about these interactions found in the biomedical literature. While several HPI databases exist that manually filter HPI protein-protein interactions from the generic databases and curated experimental interactomic studies, no comprehensive database on HPIs obtained from the biomedical literature is currently available. Here, we introduce a high-throughput literature-mining platform for extracting HPI data that includes the most comprehensive to date collection of HPIs obtained from the PubMed abstracts.

Proteins are phosphorylated by kinases, which have been studied as drug targets for the treatment of various diseases, particularly cancer. Because kinases have multiple roles in interconnected molecular pathways, their specific regulation is required to enhance beneficial and reduce adversarial effects of drugs. Using our previously developed platform, we measured phosphorylation profiles of MCF7 and K562 cells treated with 94 clinical drugs. These phosphorylation profiles can provide insights into pathway activities and biological functions. Here, we introduce Phosprof, a novel database of drug response based on phosphorylation activity. Phosprof is able to present up- or downregulated phosphorylated signature proteins on pathway maps, significant pathways on the hierarchal tree in signal transduction and commonly perturbed pathways affected by the selected drugs. It also serves as a useful web interface for new or known drug profile search based on their molecular similarity with the 94 drugs. Phosprof can be helpful for further investigation of drug responses in terms of phosphorylation by utilizing the various approved drugs whose target phenotypes are known.

However, the complete list of bone extracellular matrix proteins, their roles, and the extent of individual and cross-species variations have not been fully captured in both humans and model organisms. Here, we introduce the most comprehensive resource of bone extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that can be used in research fields such as bone regeneration, osteoporosis, and mechanobiology. The Phylobone database (available at https://phylobone.com ) includes 255 proteins potentially expressed in the bone extracellular matrix (ECM) of humans and 30 species of vertebrates. A bioinformatics pipeline was used to identify the evolutionary relationships of bone ECM proteins. The analysis facilitated the identification of potential model organisms to study the molecular mechanisms of bone regeneration. A network analysis showed high connectivity of bone ECM proteins. A total of 214 functional protein domains were identified, including collagen and the domains involved in bone formation and resorption. Information from public drug repositories was used to identify potential repurposing of existing drugs. The Phylobone database provides a platform to study bone regeneration and osteoporosis in light of (biological) evolution, and will substantially contribute to the identification of molecular mechanisms and drug targets.","8/15/2023","http://phylobone.com","Phylobone",0.983361482620239,"",0,"Phylobone",0.983361483,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37100784","PediCXR: An open, large-scale chest radiograph dataset for interpretation of common thoracic diseases in children. Computer-aided diagnosis systems in adult chest radiography (CXR) have recently achieved great success thanks to the availability of large-scale, annotated datasets and the advent of high-performance supervised learning algorithms. However, the development of diagnostic models for detecting and diagnosing pediatric diseases in CXR scans is undertaken due to the lack of high-quality physician-annotated datasets. To overcome this challenge, we introduce and release PediCXR, a new pediatric CXR dataset of 9,125 studies retrospectively collected from a major pediatric hospital in Vietnam between 2020 and 2021. Each scan was manually annotated by a pediatric radiologist with more than ten years of experience. The dataset was labeled for the presence of 36 critical findings and 15 diseases. In particular, each abnormal finding was identified via a rectangle bounding box on the image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and largest pediatric CXR dataset containing lesion-level annotations and image-level labels for the detection of multiple findings and diseases. For algorithm development, the dataset was divided into a training set of 7,728 and a test set of 1,397. To encourage new advances in pediatric CXR interpretation using data-driven approaches, we provide a detailed description of the PediCXR data sample and make the dataset publicly available on https://physionet.org/content/vindr-pcxr/1.0.0/ .","4/27/2023","http://physionet.org/content/vindr-pcxr/1.0.0","PediCXR",0.993804335594177,"",0,"PediCXR",0.993804336,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

However, biological roles of large proportions of genes across the plant phylogeny are poorly annotated. Here we describe the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Plant Gene Atlas, an updateable data resource consisting of transcript abundance assays spanning 18 diverse species. To integrate across these diverse genotypes, we analyzed expression profiles, built gene clusters that exhibited tissue/condition specific expression, and tested for transcriptional response to environmental queues.

Despite a large number of RNA-seq libraries from different treatments and genetic mutants stored in public domains, a resource for querying the intron-splicing ratio of individual intron is still required. Here, we established the first-ever large-scale splicing efficiency database in any organism. Our database includes over 57,000 plant public RNA-seq libraries, comprising 25,283 from Arabidopsis, 17,789 from maize, 10,710 from rice, and 3,974 from soybean, and covers a total of 1.6 million introns in these four species. In addition, we manually curated and annotated all the mutant- and treatment-related libraries as well as their matched controls included in our library collection, and added graphics to display intron-splicing efficiency across various tissues, developmental stages, and stress-related conditions. The result is a large collection of 3,313 treatment conditions and 3,594 genetic mutants for discovering differentially regulated splicing efficiency.

"35523906","PlantMWpIDB: a database for the molecular weight and isoelectric points of the plant proteomes. The molecular weight and isoelectric point of the proteins are very important parameters that control their subcellular localization and subsequent function. Although the genome sequence data of the plant kingdom improved enormously, the proteomic details have been poorly elaborated. Therefore, we have calculated the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the plant proteins and reported them in this database. A database, PlantMWpIDB, containing protein data from 342 plant proteomes was created to provide information on plant proteomes for hypothesis formulation in basic research and for biotechnological applications. The Molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) are important molecular parameters of proteins that are useful when conducting protein studies involving 2D gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and X-ray protein crystallography. PlantMWpIDB provides an easy-to-use and efficient interface for search options and generates a summary of basic protein parameters. The database represents a virtual 2D proteome map of plants, and the molecular weight and pI of a protein can be obtained by searching on the name of a protein, a keyword, or by a list of accession numbers. The PlantMWpIDB database also allows one to query protein sequences. The database can be found in the following link https://plantmwpidb.com/ . The individual 2D virtual proteome map of the plant kingdom will enable us to understand the proteome diversity between different species. Further, the molecular weight and isoelectric point of individual proteins can enable us to understand their functional significance in different species.","5/6/2022","http://plantmwpidb.com","PlantMWpIDB",0.990954220294952,"",0,"PlantMWpIDB",0.99095422,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Nearly 200 plant genomes have been sequenced over the last two years, and new functions of plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have been revealed. Therefore, timely update of the plant miRNA databases by incorporating miRNAs from the newly sequenced species and functional information is required to provide useful resources for advancing plant miRNA research. Here we report the update of PmiREN2.0 (https://pmiren.com/) with an addition of 19 363 miRNA entries from 91 plants, doubling the amount of data in the original version. Meanwhile, abundant regulatory information centred on miRNAs was added, including predicted upstream transcription factors through binding motifs scanning and elaborate annotation of miRNA targets. As an example, a genome-wide regulatory network centred on miRNAs was constructed for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, phylogenetic trees of conserved miRNA families were built to expand the understanding of miRNA evolution across the plant lineages. These data are helpful to deduce the regulatory relationships concerning miRNA functions in diverse plants. Beside the new data, a suite of design tools was incorporated to facilitate experimental practice. Finally, a forum named 'PmiREN Community' was added for discussion and resource and new discovery sharing. With these upgrades, PmiREN2.0 should serve the community better and accelerate miRNA research in plants.","1/1/2022","http://pmiren.com","PmiREN2.0",0.994572391112646,"",0,"PmiREN2.0",0.994572391,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"34551435","PncsHub: a platform for annotating and analyzing non-classically secreted proteins in Gram-positive bacteria. From industry to food to health, bacteria play an important role in all facets of life. Some of the most important bacteria have been purposely engineered to produce commercial quantities of antibiotics and therapeutics, and non-classical secretion systems are at the forefront of these technologies. Unlike the classical Sec or Tat pathways, non-classically secreted proteins share few common characteristics and use much more diverse secretion pathways for protein transport. Systematically categorizing and investigating the non-classically secreted proteins will enable a deeper understanding of their associated secretion mechanisms and provide a landscape of the Gram-positive secretion pathway distribution. We therefore developed PncsHub (https://pncshub.erc.monash.edu/), the first universal platform for comprehensively annotating and analyzing Gram-positive bacterial non-classically secreted proteins.

Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormally expanded Cytosine, Adenine, Guanine (CAG) triplet repeat sequences in the coding region of otherwise unrelated genes. Until now, nine different polyQ diseases have been described: Huntington's disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and six types of spinocerebellar ataxias-1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17. The pathogenic expansion translates into an aberrant tract of glutamines in the encoded proteins, compromising several cellular functions and biological processes. There is currently no cure available for the progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by the ensuing cytotoxic alterations. Although each disease is considered rare, polyQ diseases constitute the largest group of monogenic neurodegenerative disorders. Information about these disorders is scattered among several books, articles and general databases, hindering exploration by students and researchers, but also by patients and their families. Therefore, we aimed to develop a free online database to fill this gap, by centralizing relevant available information. The PolyQ Database is a platform that focuses on all nine polyQ diseases and offers information about topics that are pertinent for scientists, clinicians and the general public, including epidemiology, the characteristics of the causative genes and the codified proteins, the pathophysiology of the diseases and the main clinical manifestations. The database is available at https://polyq.pt/, and it is the first of its kind, focusing exclusively on this group of rare diseases. The database was conceived to be continuously updated and allow incorporation and dissemination of the latest information on polyQ diseases.","8/1/2023","http://polyq.pt","PolyQ",0.910612463951111,"",0,"PolyQ",0.910612464,1,"","26980520","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","merge all ""dup name"" IDs","",NA,""

We created the PDX Network (PDXNet) portal (https://portal.pdxnetwork.org/) to centralize access to the National Cancer Institute-funded PDXNet consortium resources, to facilitate collaboration among researchers and to make these data easily available for research. The portal includes sections for resources, analysis results, metrics for PDXNet activities, data processing protocols and training materials for processing PDX data. Currently, the portal contains PDXNet model information and data resources from 334 new models across 33 cancer types. Tissue samples of these models were deposited in the NCI's Patient-Derived Model Repository (PDMR) for public access. These models have 2134 associated sequencing files from 873 samples across 308 patients, which are hosted on the Cancer Genomics Cloud powered by Seven Bridges and the NCI Cancer Data Service for long-term storage and access with dbGaP permissions. The portal includes results from freely available, robust, validated and standardized analysis workflows on PDXNet sequencing files and PDMR data (3857 samples from 629 patients across 85 disease types). The PDXNet portal is continuously updated with new data and is of significant utility to the cancer research community as it provides a centralized location for PDXNet resources, which support multi-agent treatment studies, determination of sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and preclinical trials.","4/22/2022","http://portal.pdxnetwork.org","PDXNet",0.996842101216316,"",0,"PDXNet",0.996842101,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in post-transcriptional regulation. Accurate identification of RBP binding sites in multiple cell lines and tissue types from diverse species is a fundamental endeavor towards understanding the regulatory mechanisms of RBPs under both physiological and pathological conditions.

Single-point mutations of certain residues (so-called hot spots) impair/disrupt protein-protein interactions (PPIs), leading to pathogenesis and drug resistance.

By defining PPI-hot spots based on mutations that have been manually curated in UniProtKB to significantly impair/disrupt PPIs in addition to binding free energy changes, we have greatly expanded the number of distinct PPI-hot spots by an order of magnitude. These experimentally determined PPI-hot spots along with available structures have been collected in a database called PPI-HotspotDB. We have applied the PPI-HotspotDB to create a nonredundant benchmark, PPI-Hotspot+PDBBM, for assessing methods to predict PPI-hot spots using the free structure as input.

"36828269","ProSeqAProDB: Prosequence Assisted Protein Database. In early 1990s, several proteins were shown to depend on additional stretches of polypeptide (termed as prosequence/prodomain) for their folding. These regions of the protein were often termed as IMCs (Intra Molecular Chaperones), since they would be cleaved from the mature folded protein eventually. Such proteins were hypothesized to face a kinetic barrier to their folding, which was probably lowered by the prosequences. In last three decades, numerous examples of such proteins have accumulated in literature. Yet, no study has been reported so far attempting to understand the evolutionary differences and similaritess of such proteins. Till date such proteins are continued to be treated as anomalous variants, rather than as representatives of any alternate protein folding strategy. Do such proteins have any distinctive structural facets OR typical biological roles, necessitating an unconventional strategy of protein folding? Do prosequences carry any unique or conserved features that are essential to their function? ProSeqAProDb: ProSequence Assisted Protein Database, (which can be accessed at https://proseqaprodb.mkulab.in) was built as a comprehensive database, to systematically study such proteins along with their pro-sequences. The database currently contains 2140 prosequence assisted proteins (1848 eukaryotic, 255 bacterial, 24 viral and 13 archaeal proteins), from 690 organisms later categorised into 960 families.

Understanding how protein structure affects oxidation-reduction energetics is crucial for studying metabolism, creating bioelectronic systems, and tracing the history of biological energy utilization on Earth. We constructed ProtReDox (https://protein-redox-potential.web.app), a manually curated database of experimentally determined redox potentials. With over 500 measurements, we can begin to identify how proteins modulate oxidation-reduction energetics across the tree of life. By mapping redox potentials onto networks of oxidoreductase fold evolution, we can infer the evolution of electron transfer energetics over deep time.

"37947313","AFRbase: a database of protein mutations responsible for antifungal resistance. Motivation Fungal pathogens are known to cause life threatening invasive infections with rising global mortality rates. Besides, the indiscriminate use of antifungals in both clinics and agriculture has promoted antifungal drug resistance in the last decade. Fungi can show drug resistance by a variety of mechanisms. But primary driver in all these hitherto documented mechanisms is stable and heritable point mutations in the key proteins. Therefore, cataloguing mutations that can confer resistance is the first step toward understanding the mechanisms leading to the emergence of antifungal resistance. Results In the present, work we have described a database of all the mutations responsible for antifungal resistance. Named as antifungal resistance database (AFRbase), it is better than the existing databases of antifungal resistance namely, FunResDB and MARDy which have a limited scope and inadequate information. Data of AFRbase was collected using both text mining and manual curation. AFRbase provides a separate window for visualization of mutations in the 2D and 3D formats making it easy for researchers to analyze the mutation data and ensures interoperability with other standard molecular biology databases like NCBI and UniProtKB. We hope AFRbase can be useful to both clinicians and basic biomedical scientists as we envision it as an important resource for genotypic susceptibility testing of fungi and to study/predict the course of evolution of antifungal resistance. The current version of AFRbase contains manually curated 3691 unique mutations present in 29 proteins of 32 fungal species along with the information of drugs against which resistance is caused.

"35389344","Protist.guru: A Comparative Transcriptomics Database for Protists. During the last few decades, the study of microbial ecology has been enabled by molecular and genomic data. DNA sequencing has revealed the surprising extent of microbial diversity and how microbial processes run global ecosystems. However, significant gaps in our understanding of the microbial world remain, and one example is that microbial eukaryotes, or protists, are still largely neglected. To address this gap, we used gene expression data from 17 protist species to create protist.guru: an online database equipped with tools for identifying co-expressed genes, gene families, and co-expression clusters enriched for specific biological functions. Here, we show how our database can be used to reveal genes involved in essential pathways, such as the synthesis of secondary carotenoids in Haematococcus lacustris. We expect protist.guru to serve as a valuable resource for protistologists, as well as a catalyst for discoveries and new insights into the biological processes of microbial eukaryotes.

"35234850","PSINDB: the postsynaptic protein-protein interaction database. The postsynaptic region is the receiving part of the synapse comprising thousands of proteins forming an elaborate and dynamically changing network indispensable for the molecular mechanisms behind fundamental phenomena such as learning and memory. Despite the growing amount of information about individual protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in this network, these data are mostly scattered in the literature or stored in generic databases that are not designed to display aspects that are fundamental to the understanding of postsynaptic functions. To overcome these limitations, we collected postsynaptic PPIs complemented by a high amount of detailed structural and biological information and launched a freely available resource, the Postsynaptic Interaction Database (PSINDB), to make these data and annotations accessible. PSINDB includes tens of thousands of binding regions together with structural features, mediating and regulating the formation of PPIs, annotated with detailed experimental information about each interaction.

"35227289","PSnpBind: a database of mutated binding site protein-ligand complexes constructed using a multithreaded virtual screening workflow. A key concept in drug design is how natural variants, especially the ones occurring in the binding site of drug targets, affect the inter-individual drug response and efficacy by altering binding affinity. These effects have been studied on very limited and small datasets while, ideally, a large dataset of binding affinity changes due to binding site single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is needed for evaluation. However, to the best of our knowledge, such a dataset does not exist. Thus, a reference dataset of ligands binding affinities to proteins with all their reported binding sites' variants was constructed using a molecular docking approach. Having a large database of protein-ligand complexes covering a wide range of binding pocket mutations and a large small molecules' landscape is of great importance for several types of studies. For example, developing machine learning algorithms to predict protein-ligand affinity or a SNP effect on it requires an extensive amount of data. In this work, we present PSnpBind: A large database of 0.6 million mutated binding site protein-ligand complexes constructed using a multithreaded virtual screening workflow. It provides a web interface to explore and visualize the protein-ligand complexes and a REST API to programmatically access the different aspects of the database contents.

"36548389","PTMint database of experimentally verified PTM regulation on protein-protein interaction. Motivation Post-translational modification (PTM) is an important biochemical process. which includes six most well-studied types: phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, ubiquitylation and glycosylation. PTM is involved in various cell signaling pathways and biological processes. Abnormal PTM status is closely associated with severe diseases (such as cancer and neurologic diseases) by regulating protein functions, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs). A set of databases was constructed separately for PTM sites and PPI; however, the resource of regulation for PTM on PPI is still unsolved. Results Here, we firstly constructed a public accessible database of PTMint (PTMs that are associated with PPIs) (https://ptmint.sjtu.edu.cn/) that contains manually curated complete experimental evidence of the PTM regulation on PPIs in multiple organisms, including Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Currently, the first version of PTMint encompassed 2477 non-redundant PTM sites in 1169 proteins affecting 2371 protein-protein pairs involving 357 diseases. Various annotations were systematically integrated, such as protein sequence, structure properties and protein complex analysis.

In this paper, we present an integrative database of quantitative PTMs in plants named qPTMplants (http://qptmplants.omicsbio.info), which hosts 1√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†242√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†365 experimentally identified PTM events for 429√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†821 nonredundant sites on 123√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†551 proteins under 583 conditions for 23 PTM types in 43 plant species from 293 published studies, with 620√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†509 quantification events for 136√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†700 PTM sites on 55√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†361 proteins under 354 conditions.

Then, various search and browse functions were implemented to access the qPTMplants data in a user-friendly manner. Overall, we anticipate that the qPTMplants database will be a valuable resource for further research on PTMs in plants.","1/1/2022","http://qptmplants.omicsbio.info","qPTMplants",0.993981301784515,"",0,"qPTMplants",0.993981302,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"35584008, 26527724","RegulonDB 11.0: Comprehensive high-throughput datasets on transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K-12. Genomics has set the basis for a variety of methodologies that produce high-throughput datasets identifying the different players that define gene regulation, particularly regulation of transcription initiation and operon organization. These datasets are available in public repositories, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus, or ArrayExpress. However, accessing and navigating such a wealth of data is not straightforward. No resource currently exists that offers all available high and low-throughput data on transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K-12 to easily use both as whole datasets, or as individual interactions and regulatory elements. RegulonDB (https://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx) began gathering high-throughput dataset collections in 2009, starting with transcription start sites, then adding ChIP-seq and gSELEX in 2012, with up to 99 different experimental high-throughput datasets available in 2019. In this paper we present a radical upgrade to more than 2000 high-throughput datasets, processed to facilitate their comparison, introducing up-to-date collections of transcription termination sites, transcription units, as well as transcription factor binding interactions derived from ChIP-seq, ChIP-exo, gSELEX and DAP-seq experiments, besides expression profiles derived from RNA-seq experiments. For ChIP-seq experiments we offer both the data as presented by the authors, as well as data uniformly processed in-house, enhancing their comparability, as well as the traceability of the methods and reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, we have expanded the tools available for browsing and visualization across and within datasets. We include comparisons against previously existing knowledge in RegulonDB from classic experiments, a nucleotide-resolution genome viewer, and an interface that enables users to browse datasets by querying their metadata. A particular effort was made to automatically extract detailed experimental growth conditions by implementing an assisted curation strategy applying Natural language processing and machine learning. We provide summaries with the total number of interactions found in each experiment, as well as tools to identify common results among different experiments. This is a long-awaited resource to make use of such wealth of knowledge and advance our understanding of the biology of the model bacterium E. coli K-12.","5/1/2022","http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx","RegulonDB",0.998138189,"",0,"RegulonDB",0.998138189,2,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"36200838","AgeAnno: a knowledgebase of single-cell annotation of aging in human. Aging is a complex process that accompanied by molecular and cellular alterations. The identification of tissue-/cell type-specific biomarkers of aging and elucidation of the detailed biological mechanisms of aging-related genes at the single-cell level can help to understand the heterogeneous aging process and design targeted anti-aging therapeutics. Here, we built AgeAnno (https://relab.xidian.edu.cn/AgeAnno/#/), a knowledgebase of single cell annotation of aging in human, aiming to provide comprehensive characterizations for aging-related genes across diverse tissue-cell types in human by using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing data (scRNA and scATAC). The current version of AgeAnno houses 1 678 610 cells from 28 healthy tissue samples with ages ranging from 0 to 110 years. We collected 5580 aging-related genes from previous resources and performed dynamic functional annotations of the cellular context. For the scRNA data, we performed analyses include differential gene expression, gene variation coefficient, cell communication network, transcription factor (TF) regulatory network, and immune cell proportionc. AgeAnno also provides differential chromatin accessibility analysis, motif/TF enrichment and footprint analysis, and co-accessibility peak analysis for scATAC data. AgeAnno will be a unique resource to systematically characterize aging-related genes across diverse tissue-cell types in human, and it could facilitate antiaging and aging-related disease research.","1/1/2023","http://relab.xidian.edu.cn/AgeAnno","AgeAnno",0.9983851313591,"",0,"AgeAnno",0.998385131,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"36694725","CAFuncAPA: a knowledgebase for systematic functional annotations of APA events in human cancers. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread posttranscriptional regulation process. APA generates diverse mRNA isoforms with different 3' UTR lengths, affecting mRNA expression, miRNA binding regulation and alternative splicing events. Previous studies have demonstrated the important roles of APA in tumorigenesis and cancer progression through diverse aspects. Thus, a comprehensive functional landscape of diverse APA events would aid in a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms related to APA in human cancers. Here, we built CAFuncAPA (https://relab.xidian.edu.cn/CAFuncAPA/) to systematically annotate the functions of 15478 APA events in human pan-cancers. Specifically, we first identified APA events associated with cancer survival and tumor progression. We annotated the potential downstream effects of APA on genes/isoforms expression, regulation of miRNAs, RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and alternative splicing events. Moreover, we also identified up-regulators of APA events, including the effects of genetic variants on poly(A) sites and RBPs, as well as the effect of methylation phenotypes on APA events. These findings suggested that CAFuncAPA can be a helpful resource for a better understanding of APA regulators and potential functions in cancer biology.","1/23/2023","http://relab.xidian.edu.cn/CAFuncAPA","CAFuncAPA",0.998106956481934,"",0,"CAFuncAPA",0.998106956,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37223738","Grad-seq analysis of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium provides a global view of RNA and protein complexes in these two opportunistic pathogens. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are major nosocomial pathogens. Despite their relevance to public health and their role in the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance, relatively little is known about gene regulation in these species. RNA-protein complexes serve crucial functions in all cellular processes associated with gene expression, including post-transcriptional control mediated by small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Here, we present a new resource for the study of enterococcal RNA biology, employing the Grad-seq technique to comprehensively predict complexes formed by RNA and proteins in E. faecalis V583 and E. faecium AUS0004. Analysis of the generated global RNA and protein sedimentation profiles led to the identification of RNA-protein complexes and putative novel sRNAs. Validating our data sets, we observe well-established cellular RNA-protein complexes such as the 6S RNA-RNA polymerase complex, suggesting that 6S RNA-mediated global control of transcription is conserved in enterococci. Focusing on the largely uncharacterized RNA-binding protein KhpB, we use the RIP-seq technique to predict that KhpB interacts with sRNAs, tRNAs, and untranslated regions of mRNAs, and might be involved in the processing of specific tRNAs. Collectively, these datasets provide departure points for in-depth studies of the cellular interactome of enterococci that should facilitate functional discovery in these and related Gram-positive species.

"36124670","QUADRatlas: the RNA G-quadruplex and RG4-binding proteins database. RNA G-quadruplexes (RG4s) are non-canonical, disease-associated post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression whose functions are driven by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Being able to explore transcriptome-wide RG4 formation and interaction with RBPs is thus paramount to understanding how they are regulated and exploiting them as potential therapeutic targets. Towards this goal, we present QUADRatlas (https://rg4db.cibio.unitn.it), a database of experimentally-derived and computationally predicted RG4s in the human transcriptome, enriched with biological function and disease associations. As RBPs are key to their function, we mined known interactions of RG4s with such proteins, complemented with an extensive RBP binding sites dataset. Users can thus intersect RG4s with their potential regulators and effectors, enabling the formulation of novel hypotheses on RG4 regulation, function√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†and pathogenicity.

Recent advances in Cryo-EM led to a surge of ribosome structures deposited over the past years, including structures from different species, conformational states, or bound with different ligands. Yet, multiple conflicts of nomenclature make the identification and comparison of structures and ortholog components challenging. We present RiboXYZ (available at https://ribosome.xyz), a database that provides organized access to ribosome structures, with several tools for visualisation and study. The database is up-to-date with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) but provides a standardized nomenclature that allows for searching and comparing ribosomal components (proteins, RNA, ligands) across all the available structures. In addition to structured and simplified access to the data, the application has several specialized visualization tools, including the identification and prediction of ligand binding sites, and 3D superimposition of ribosomal components. Overall, RiboXYZ provides a useful toolkit that complements the PDB database, by implementing the current conventions and providing a set of auxiliary tools that have been developed explicitly for analyzing ribosome structures. This toolkit can be easily accessed by both experts and non-experts in structural biology so that they can search, visualize and compare structures, with various potential applications in molecular biology, evolution, and biochemistry.","1/1/2023","http://ribosome.xyz","RiboXYZ",0.995915710926056,"",0,"RiboXYZ",0.995915711,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36146935","RNAapt3D: RNA aptamer 3D-structural modeling database. RNA aptamers are oligonucleotides with high binding affinity and specificity for target molecules and are expected to be a new generation of therapeutic molecules and targeted delivery materials.

The pathological mechanisms of diseases must be understood in detail to guide drug design. In developing RNA aptamers as drugs, information about the interaction mechanisms and structures of RNA aptamer-target protein complexes are useful.

"37221043","RNA-Chrom: a manually curated analytical database of RNA-chromatin interactome. Every year there is more and more evidence that non-coding RNAs play an important role in biological processes affecting various levels of organization of living systems: from the cellular (regulation of gene expression, remodeling and maintenance of chromatin structure, co-transcriptional suppression of transposons, splicing, post-transcriptional RNA modifications, etc.) to cell populations and even organismal ones (development, aging, cancer, cardiovascular and many other diseases). The development and creation of mutually complementary databases that will aggregate, unify and structure different types of data can help to reach the system level of studying non-coding RNAs. Here we present the RNA-Chrom manually curated analytical database, which contains the coordinates of billions of contacts of thousands of human and mouse RNAs with chromatin. Through the user-friendly web interface (https://rnachrom2.bioinf.fbb.msu.ru/), two approaches to the analysis of the RNA-chromatin interactome were implemented. Firstly, to find out whether the RNA of interest to a user contacts with chromatin, and if so, with which genes or DNA loci? Secondly, to find out which RNAs are in contact with the DNA locus of interest to a user (and probably participate in its regulation), and if there are such, what is the nature of their interaction? For a more detailed study of contact maps and their comparison with other data, the web interface allows a user to view them in the UCSC Genome Browser.

Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are typically defined as translation sites located within the 5' untranslated region upstream of the main protein coding sequence (CDS) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Although uORFs are prevalent in eukaryotic mRNAs and modulate the translation of downstream CDSs, a comprehensive resource for uORFs is currently lacking. We developed Ribo-uORF (http://rnainformatics.org.cn/RiboUORF) to serve as a comprehensive functional resource for uORF analysis based on ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) data. Ribo-uORF currently supports six species: human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, and worm. Ribo-uORF includes 501 554 actively translated uORFs and 107 914 upstream translation initiation sites (uTIS), which were identified from 1495 Ribo-seq and 77 quantitative translation initiation sequencing (QTI-seq) datasets, respectively. We also developed mRNAbrowse to visualize items such as uORFs, cis-regulatory elements, genetic variations, eQTLs, GWAS-based associations, RNA modifications, and RNA editing. Ribo-uORF provides a very intuitive web interface for conveniently browsing, searching, and visualizing uORF data. Finally, uORFscan and UTR5var were developed in Ribo-uORF to precisely identify uORFs and analyze the influence of genetic mutations on uORFs using user-uploaded datasets.

"35809063","RNAloops: a database of RNA multiloops. Motivation Knowledge of the 3D structure of RNA supports discovering its functions and is crucial for designing drugs and modern therapeutic solutions. Thus, much attention is devoted to experimental determination and computational prediction targeting the global fold of RNA and its local substructures. The latter include multi-branched loops-functionally significant elements that highly affect the spatial shape of the entire molecule. Unfortunately, their computational modeling constitutes a weak point of structural bioinformatics. A remedy for this is in collecting these motifs and analyzing their features. Results RNAloops is a self-updating database that stores multi-branched loops identified in the PDB-deposited RNA structures.

"35913188","Multilayered Networks of SalmoNet2 Enable Strain Comparisons of the Salmonella Genus on a Molecular Level. Serovars of the genus Salmonella primarily evolved as gastrointestinal pathogens in a wide range of hosts. Some serotypes later evolved further, adopting a more invasive lifestyle in a narrower host range associated with systemic infections. A system-level knowledge of these pathogens could identify the complex adaptations associated with the evolution of serovars with distinct pathogenicity, host range, and risk to human health. This promises to aid the design of interventions and serve as a knowledge base in the Salmonella research community. Here, we present SalmoNet2, a major update to SalmoNet1, the first multilayered interaction resource for Salmonella strains, containing protein-protein, transcriptional regulatory, and enzyme-enzyme interactions. The new version extends the number of Salmonella networks from 11 to 20. We now include a strain from the second species in the Salmonella genus, a strain from the Salmonella enterica subspecies arizonae and additional strains of importance from the subspecies enterica, including S. Typhimurium strain D23580, an epidemic multidrug-resistant strain associated with invasive nontyphoidal salmonellosis (iNTS). The database now uses strain specific metabolic models instead of a generalized model to highlight differences between strains. The update has increased the coverage of high-quality protein-protein interactions, and enhanced interoperability with other computational resources by adopting standardized formats. The resource website has been updated with tutorials to help researchers analyze their Salmonella data using molecular interaction networks from SalmoNet2. SalmoNet2 is accessible at http://salmonet.org/. IMPORTANCE Multilayered network databases collate interaction information from multiple sources, and are powerful both as a knowledge base and subject of analysis. Here, we present SalmoNet2, an integrated network resource containing protein-protein, transcriptional regulatory, and metabolic interactions for 20 Salmonella strains. Key improvements to the update include expanding the number of strains, strain-specific metabolic networks, an increase in high-quality protein-protein interactions, community standard computational formats to help interoperability, and online tutorials to help users analyze their data using SalmoNet2.","8/1/2022","http://salmonet.org","SalmoNet2",0.994874477386475,"",0,"SalmoNet2",0.994874477,1,"29057095","","","","merge on record with best name prob","","",NA,""

"35502202","Tracking SARS-CoV-2 mutations and variants through the COG-UK-Mutation Explorer. COG-UK Mutation Explorer (COG-UK-ME, https://sars2.cvr.gla.ac.uk/cog-uk/-last accessed date 16 March 2022) is a web resource that displays knowledge and analyses on SARS-CoV-2 virus genome mutations and variants circulating in the UK, with a focus on the observed amino acid replacements that have an antigenic role in the context of the human humoral and cellular immune response. This analysis is based on more than 2 million genome sequences (as of March 2022) for UK SARS-CoV-2 data held in the CLIMB-COVID centralised data environment. COG-UK-ME curates these data and displays analyses that are cross-referenced to experimental data collated from the primary literature. The aim is to track mutations of immunological importance that are accumulating in current variants of concern and variants of interest that could alter the neutralising activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), convalescent sera, and vaccines. Changes in epitopes recognised by T cells, including those where reduced T cell binding has been demonstrated, are reported. Mutations that have been shown to confer SARS-CoV-2 resistance to antiviral drugs are also included. Using visualisation tools, COG-UK-ME also allows users to identify the emergence of variants carrying mutations that could decrease the neutralising activity of both mAbs present in therapeutic cocktails, e.g. Ronapreve. COG-UK-ME tracks changes in the frequency of combinations of mutations and brings together the curated literature on the impact of those mutations on various functional aspects of the virus and therapeutics. Given the unpredictable nature of SARS-CoV-2 as exemplified by yet another variant of concern, Omicron, continued surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative to monitor virus evolution linked to the efficacy of therapeutics.","3/18/2022","http://sars2.cvr.gla.ac.uk/cog-uk/-last","COG-UK-ME",0.98530720671018,"COG-UK Mutation Explorer",0.956903806754521,"COG-UK-ME",0.985307207,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic viral infection of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulted in the global pandemic of 2020. A lack of therapeutic and preventive strategies has quickly posed significant threats to world health. A comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and natural selection, how it impacts host interaction, and phenotype symptoms is vital to develop effective strategies against the virus. The SARS2Mutant database (http://sars2mutant.com/) was developed to provide valuable insights based on millions of high-quality, high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 complete protein sequences. Users of this database have the ability to search for information on three amino acid substitution mutation strategies based on gene name, geographical zone, or comparative analysis. Each strategy is presented in five distinct formats which includes: (i) mutated sample frequencies, (ii) heat maps of mutated amino acid positions, (iii) mutation survivals, (iv) natural selections√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†and (v) details of substituted amino acids, including their names, positions, and frequencies.

To organize these protein structures efficiently, we introduce (i) a generic residue numbering scheme to enhance the comparability of different SH2 domains, (ii) a structure-based multiple sequence alignment of all 120 human wild-type SH2 domain sequences and their PDB and AlphaFold structures. The aligned sequences and structures can be searched, browsed and downloaded from the online interface of SH2db (http://sh2db.ttk.hu), with functions to conveniently prepare multiple structures into a Pymol session, and to export simple charts on the contents of the database.

"35762265","metaPR2 : A database of eukaryotic 18S rRNA metabarcodes with an emphasis on protists. In recent years, metabarcoding has become the method of choice for investigating the composition and assembly of microbial eukaryotic communities. The number of environmental data sets published has increased very rapidly. Although unprocessed sequence files are often publicly available, processed data, in particular clustered sequences, are rarely available in a usable format. Clustered sequences are reported as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with different similarity levels or more recently as amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). This hampers comparative studies between different environments and data sets, for example examining the biogeographical patterns of specific groups/species, as well analysing the genetic microdiversity within these groups. Here, we present a newly-assembled database of processed 18S rRNA metabarcodes that are annotated with the PR2 reference sequence database. This database, called metaPR2 , contains 41 data sets corresponding to more than 4000 samples and 90,000 ASVs.

Hence, we have developed SignaLink3 (http://signalink.org/), a value-added knowledge-base that provides manually curated data on signaling pathways and integrated data from several types of databases (interaction, regulation, localisation, disease, etc.) for humans, and three major animal model organisms. SignaLink3 contains over 400 000 newly added human protein-protein interactions resulting in a total of 700 000 interactions for Homo sapiens, making it one of the largest integrated signaling network resources. Next to H. sapiens, SignaLink3 is the only current signaling network resource to provide regulatory information for the model species Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio rerio, and the largest resource for Drosophila melanogaster. Compared to previous versions, we have integrated gene expression data as well as subcellular localization of the interactors, therefore uniquely allowing tissue-, or compartment-specific pathway interaction analysis to create more accurate models.

Background In return for their nutritional properties and broad availability, cereal crops have been associated with different alimentary disorders and symptoms, with the majority of the responsibility being attributed to gluten. Therefore, the research of gluten-related literature data continues to be produced at ever-growing rates, driven in part by the recent exploratory studies that link gluten to non-traditional diseases and the popularity of gluten-free diets, making it increasingly difficult to access and analyse practical and structured information. In this sense, the accelerated discovery of novel advances in diagnosis and treatment, as well as exploratory studies, produce a favourable scenario for disinformation and misinformation.

Results and conclusions In this sense, 5814 documents were manually annotated and 7424 were fully automatically processed to reconstruct the first online gluten-related knowledge database of evidenced health-related interactions that produce health or metabolic changes based on the literature.

Recent evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the development and progression of breast cancer. However, despite increasing data and evidence indicating the implication of lncRNAs in breast cancer, no web resource or database exists primarily for lncRNAs associated with only breast cancer. Therefore, we developed a manually curated, comprehensive database, ""BCLncRDB,"" for lncRNAs associated with breast cancer. For this, we collected, processed, and analyzed available data on breast cancer-associated lncRNAs from different sources, including previously published research articles, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Ensembl database; subsequently, these data were hosted at BCLncRDB for public access. Currently, the database contains 5324 unique breast cancer-lncRNA associations and has the following features: (i) a user-friendly, easy-to-use web interface for searching and browsing about lncRNAs of the user's interest, (ii) differentially expressed and methylated lncRNAs, (iii) stage- and subtype-specific lncRNAs, and (iv) drugs, subcellular localization, sequence, and chromosome information of these lncRNAs.

"36287286","CmirC: an integrated database of clustered miRNAs co-localized with copy number variations in cancer. Genomic rearrangements and copy number variations (CNVs) are the major regulators of clustered microRNAs (miRNAs) expression. Several clustered miRNAs are harbored in and around chromosome fragile sites (CFSs) and cancer-associated genomic hotspots. Aberrant expression of such clusters can lead to oncogenic or tumor suppressor activities. Here, we developed CmirC (Clustered miRNAs co-localized with CNVs), a comprehensive database of clustered miRNAs co-localized with CNV regions. The database consists of 481 clustered miRNAs co-localized with CNVs and their expression patterns in 35 cancer types of the TCGA. The portal also provides information on CFSs, miRNA cluster candidates, genomic coordinates, target gene networks, and gene functionality.

"37208450","Sulfur metabolism in subtropical marine mangrove sediments fundamentally differs from other habitats as revealed by SMDB. Shotgun metagenome sequencing provides the opportunity to recover underexplored rare populations and identify difficult-to-elucidate biochemical pathways. However, information on sulfur genes, including their sequences, is scattered in public databases. Here, we introduce SMDB ( https://smdb.gxu.edu.cn/ )-a manually curated database of sulfur genes based on an in-depth review of the scientific literature and orthology database. The SMDB contained a total of 175 genes and covered 11 sulfur metabolism processes with 395,737 representative sequences affiliated with 110 phyla and 2340 genera of bacteria/archaea. The SMDB was applied to characterize the sulfur cycle from five habitats and compared the microbial diversity of mangrove sediments with that of other habitats. The structure and composition of microorganism communities and sulfur genes were significantly different among the five habitats. Our results show that microorganism alpha diversity in mangrove sediments was significantly higher than in other habitats. Genes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction were abundant in subtropical marine mangroves and deep-sea sediments. The neutral community model results showed that microbial dispersal was higher in the marine mangrove ecosystem than in others habitats. The Flavilitoribacter of sulfur-metabolizing microorganism becomes a reliable biomarker in the five habitats. SMDB will assist researchers to analyze genes of sulfur cycle from the metagenomic efficiently.","5/19/2023","http://smdb.gxu.edu.cn","SMDB",0.983671188354492,"",0,"SMDB",0.983671188,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37681739","The Soybean Expression Atlas v2: A comprehensive database of over 5000 RNA-seq samples. Soybean is a crucial crop worldwide, used as a source of food, feed, and industrial products due to its high protein and oil content. Previously, the rapid accumulation of soybean RNA-seq data in public databases and the computational challenges of processing raw RNA-seq data motivated us to develop the Soybean Expression Atlas, a gene expression database of over a thousand RNA-seq samples. Over the past few years, our database has allowed researchers to explore the expression profiles of important gene families, discover genes associated with agronomic traits, and understand the transcriptional dynamics of cellular processes. Here, we present the Soybean Expression Atlas v2, an updated version of our database with a fourfold increase in the number of samples, featuring transcript- and gene-level transcript abundance matrices for 5481 publicly available RNA-seq samples. New features in our database include the availability of transcript-level abundance estimates and equivalence classes to explore differential transcript usage, abundance estimates in bias-corrected counts to increase the accuracy of differential gene expression analyses, a new web interface with improved data visualization and user experience, and a reproducible and scalable pipeline available as an R package.

"37735613","SoyDBean: a database for SNPs reconciliation by multiple versions of soybean reference genomes. Due to the development of sequence technology and decreased cost, many whole genome sequences have been obtained. As a result, extensive genetic variations have been discovered from many populations and germplasms to understand the genetic diversity of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.). However, assessing the quality of variation is essential because the published variants were collected using different bioinformatic methods and parameters. Furthermore, despite the enhanced genome contiguity and more efficient filling of ""N"" stretches in the new reference genome, there remains a dearth of endeavors to verify the caliber of variations present in it. The primary goal of this research was to discern a dependable set of SNPs that can withstand reconciliation across multiple reference genomes. Additionally, the investigation aimed to reconfirm the variations through the utilization of numerous whole genome sequencing data obtained from publicly available databases. Based on the result, we created datasets that comprised the thoroughly verified SNP coordinates between the reference assemblies.

Programmed cell death (PCD) refers to controlled cell death that is conducted to keep the internal environment stable. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in the progression of PCD in a variety of diseases. However, no specialized online repository is available to collect and store the associations between lncRNA-mediated PCD and diseases. Here, we developed LncPCD, a comprehensive database that provides information on experimentally supported associations of lncRNA-mediated PCD with diseases. The current version of LncPCD documents 6666 associations between five common types of PCD (apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis) and 1222 lncRNAs in 331 diseases. We also manually curated a wealth of information: (1) 7 important lncRNA regulatory mechanisms, (2) 310 PCD-associated cell types in three species, (3) detailed information on lncRNA subcellular locations and (4) clinical applications for lncRNA-mediated PCD in diseases. Additionally, 10 single-cell sequencing datasets were integrated into LncPCD to characterize the dynamics of lncRNAs in diseases. Overall, LncPCD is an extremely useful resource for understanding the functions and mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated PCD in diseases.

"37793493","First Argentine database for the accurate identification of Brucella to species level by MALDI-TOF MS. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) has proven to be a fast and reliable method for the identification of a large number of taxonomic groups. It offers the advantage of being able to incorporate protein spectra of microorganisms that are absent or poorly represented in commercial databases, such as the genus Brucella. The aim of the study was to build the first database of protein spectra of local biological variants of Brucella in Argentina and of standard strains.

Due to the limitation found, an in-house database was designed with local Brucella isolates from Argentina and standard strains used in routine bacteriological diagnosis. For its validation, a panel of strains, different from those used to develop the extended local database (n: 177), was used to, simultaneously, challenge both libraries. The samples were processed by triplicate and the results obtained were: 177 strains correctly identified to genus and species level compared to the gold standard method (phenotypic typing), meeting the criteria accepted by the literature and the manufacturer as reliable identification. Only 2 of these isolates had score values lower than 2 (1.862) and were therefore not included in the calculation of results. According to these results, MALDI-TOF MS is a fast and reliable method for the routine identification of the different Brucella species, and even has the advantage of reducing the time of exposure to pathogenic microorganisms for laboratorians. It could be considered a valuable technique to replace, in the near future, the current conventional techniques due to the ease of transferring protein spectra, avoiding the use of reference strains that are difficult to find commercially available and commonly used in phenotypic typing.","10/2/2023","http://spectra.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/spectra","MALDI",0.88645947,"",0,"MALDI",0.8864594698,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","remove","","","FALSE POS: CLASS",NA,""

"34570216","SPENCER: a comprehensive database for small peptides encoded by noncoding RNAs in cancer patients. As an increasing number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been suggested to encode short bioactive peptides in cancer, the exploration of ncRNA-encoded small peptides (ncPEPs) is emerging as a fascinating field in cancer research. To assist in studies on the regulatory mechanisms of ncPEPs, we describe here a database called SPENCER (http://spencer.renlab.org). Currently, SPENCER has collected a total of 2806 mass spectrometry (MS) data points from 55 studies, covering 1007 tumor samples and 719 normal samples. Using an MS-based proteomics analysis pipeline, SPENCER identified 29 526 ncPEPs across 15 different cancer types. Specifically, 22 060 of these ncPEPs were experimentally validated in other studies. By comparing tumor and normal samples, the identified ncPEPs were divided into four expression groups: tumor-specific, upregulated in cancer, downregulated in cancer, and others. Additionally, since ncPEPs are potential targets for neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy, SPENCER also predicted the immunogenicity of all the identified ncPEPs by assessing their MHC-I binding affinity, stability, and TCR recognition probability. As a result, 4497 ncPEPs curated in SPENCER were predicted to be immunogenic. Overall, SPENCER will be a useful resource for investigating cancer-associated ncPEPs and may boost further research in cancer.","1/1/2022","http://spencer.renlab.org","SPENCER",0.984088242053986,"",0,"SPENCER",0.984088242,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"38128543","SplicingLore: a web resource for studying the regulation of cassette exons by human splicing factors. One challenge faced by scientists from the alternative RNA splicing field is to decode the cooperative or antagonistic effects of splicing factors (SFs) to understand and eventually predict splicing outcomes on a genome-wide scale. In this manuscript, we introduce SplicingLore, an open-access database and web resource that help to fill this gap in a straightforward manner. The database contains a collection of RNA-sequencing-derived lists of alternative exons regulated by a total of 75 different SFs. All datasets were processed in a standardized manner, ensuring valid comparisons and correlation analyses. The user can easily retrieve a factor-specific set of differentially included exons from the database or provide a list of exons and search which SF(s) control(s) their inclusion. Our simple workflow is fast and easy to run, and it ensures a reliable calculation of correlation scores between the tested datasets. As a proof of concept, we predicted and experimentally validated a novel functional cooperation between the RNA helicases DDX17 and DDX5 and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC) protein.

"36944655","The Superfund Research Program Analytics Portal: linking environmental chemical exposure to biological phenotypes. The OSU/PNNL Superfund Research Program (SRP) represents a longstanding collaboration to quantify Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) at various superfund sites in the Pacific Northwest and assess their potential impact on human health. To link the chemical measurements to biological activity, we describe the use of the zebrafish as a high-throughput developmental toxicity model that provides quantitative measurements of the exposure to chemicals. Toward this end, we have linked over 150 PAHs found at Superfund sites to the effect of these same chemicals in zebrafish, creating a rich dataset that links environmental exposure to biological response. To quantify this response, we have implemented a dose-response modelling pipeline to calculate benchmark dose parameters which enable potency comparison across over 500 chemicals and 12 of the phenotypes measured in zebrafish. We provide a rich dataset for download and analysis as well as a web portal that provides public access to this dataset via an interactive web site designed to support exploration and re-use of these data by the scientific community at http://srp.pnnl.gov .","3/21/2023","http://srp.pnnl.gov","SRP",0.748007456461589,"",0,"SRP",0.748007456,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"35659285","A database of US state policies to mitigate COVID-19 and its economic consequences. Background Since COVID-19 first appeared in the United States (US) in January 2020, US states have pursued a wide range of policies to mitigate the spread of the virus and its economic ramifications. Without unified federal guidance, states have been the front lines of the policy response. Main text We created the COVID-19 US State Policy (CUSP) database ( https://statepolicies.com/ ) to document the dates and components of economic relief and public health measures issued at the state level in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Documented interventions included school and business closures, face mask mandates, directives on vaccine eligibility, eviction moratoria, and expanded unemployment insurance benefits. By providing continually updated information, CUSP was designed to inform rapid-response, policy-relevant research in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and has been widely used to investigate the impact of state policies on population health and health equity. This paper introduces the CUSP database and highlights how it is already informing the COVID-19 pandemic response in the US. Conclusion CUSP is the most comprehensive publicly available policy database of health, social, and economic policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. CUSP documents widespread variation in state policy decisions and implementation dates across the US and serves as a freely available and valuable resource to policymakers and researchers.","6/4/2022","http://statepolicies.com","CUSP",0.995446681976318,"COVID-19 US State Policy",0.736938212599073,"CUSP",0.995446682,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36814618","StrainSelect: A novel microbiome reference database that disambiguates all bacterial strains, genome assemblies and extant cultures worldwide. Motivation: Microbial metagenomic profiling software and databases are advancing rapidly for development of novel disease biomarkers and therapeutics yet three problems impede analyses: 1) the conflation of ""genome assembly"" and ""strain"" in reference databases; 2) difficulty connecting DNA biomarkers to a procurable strain for laboratory experimentation; and 3) absence of a comprehensive and unified strain-resolved reference database for integrating both shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene data. Results: We demarcated 681,087 strains, the largest collection of its kind, by filtering public data into a knowledge graph of vertices representing contiguous DNA sequences, genome assemblies, strain monikers and bio-resource center (BRC) catalog numbers then adding inter-vertex edges only for synonyms or direct derivatives. Surprisingly, for 10,043 important strains, we found replicate RefSeq genome assemblies obstructing interpretation of database searches. We organized each strain into eight taxonomic ranks with bootstrap confidence inversely correlated with genome assembly contamination. The StrainSelect database is suited for applications where a taxonomic, functional or procurement reference is needed for shotgun or amplicon metagenomics since 636,568 strains have at least one 16S rRNA gene, 245,005 have at least one annotated genome assembly, and 36,671 are procurable from at least one BRC. The database overcomes all three aforementioned problems since it disambiguates strains from assemblies, locates strains at BRCs, and unifies a taxonomic reference for both 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomics. Availability: The StrainSelect database is available in igraph and tabular vertex-edge formats compatible with Neo4J. Dereplicated MinHash and fasta databases are distributed for sourmash and usearch pipelines at http://strainselect.secondgenome.com. Contact:todd.desantis@gmail.com.

Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions-both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.","1/1/2023","http://string-db.org","STRING",0.995607018,"",0,"STRING",0.995607018,2,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"37034094","Current status and future aspects in the Japan Stroke Data Bank. The Japanese National Plan for the Promotion of Measures Against Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Diseases was formulated on October 27, 2020. One purpose of this plan was to promote research on cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the actual status of stroke treatment in Japan and operate a national stroke database with high public interest completely and accurately. The Japan Stroke Data Bank (JSDB; https://strokedatabank.ncvc.go.jp/en/) was established by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Scientific Research in Shimane University (Shimane, Japan) in 1999 and was transferred to the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center (Osaka, Japan) as a part of the Cardiovascular Disease Registry in 2015. More than 200,000 of stroke cases have been registered using individual forms from more than 100 nationwide stroke centers over ~20 years. Since there are few large-scale stroke registries with nationwide coverage in Asia, including Japan, compared with those in Europe and North America, the role of the JSDB in the plan will be important in the future. To construct a high-quality stroke registry, we aimed to (1) collect detailed data through individual questionnaires for each participating stroke center, (2) link to external databases (e.g., insurance claims and public death registries), (3) improve the quality of treatment at participating hospitals through benchmarking, and (4) obtain stable funding through sustained support from government and academic societies. We also describe the history of the JSDB and changes in the trend of real-world stroke treatment in Japan based on the results of analysis of data in the JSDB.","3/22/2023","http://strokedatabank.ncvc.go.jp/en","JSDB",0.949941173195839,"Japan Stroke Data Bank",0.939885056018829,"JSDB",0.949941173,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

With the studies about miRNA increase in sugarcane, the researchers lack an exhaustive resource to achieve the data. To fill this gap, we developed MicroSugar, a database that supported mRNA and miRNA annotation for sugarcane (http://suc.gene-db.com). MicroSugar is an integrated resource developed for 194,528 genes including 80,746 unigenes from long reads of Pacbio platform and 468 miRNAs from 72 samples. Internode elongation (jointing) is the key biological characteristic for the growth of sugarcane tillers into sugarcane stems. The present study combined the sequencing data from the different stages in internode elongation of stem and tiller. In total, the 14,300 3' untranslated region (UTR) sequences were extracted from the gene sequences and 3019 mRNAs as target of 327 miRNA were identified by miRanda algorithm and Spearman's Rho of expression levels. To determine the gene functions regulated by these miRNAs, the gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed and it confirmed that the over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms were associated with organism formation indicating the growth controlling function by miRNAs in sugarcane. Moreover, MicroSugar is a comprehensive and integrated database with a user-friendly responsive template. By browsing, searching and downloading of the nucleotide sequences, expression and miRNA targets, the user can retrieve information promptly. The database provides a valuable resource to facilitate the understanding of miRNA in sugarcane development and growth which will contribute to the study of sugarcane and other plants.","6/24/2022","http://suc.gene-db.com","MicroSugar",0.993223309516907,"",0,"MicroSugar",0.99322331,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Sequences are linked to their biochemical and structural information according to an expert scrutiny of the available literature. Database browsing was initially made possible both through a keyword search engine and a specific sequence similarity (BLAST) server. In this article, we will briefly summarize the experimental progresses in the sulfatase field in the last 6 years. To improve and speed up the (sub)family assignment of sulfatases in (meta)genomic data, we have developed a new, freely-accessible search engine using Hidden Markov model (HMM) for each (sub)family.

"35222846","SuPepMem: A database of innate immune system peptides and their cell membrane interactions. Host defense peptides (HDPs) are short cationic peptides that play a key role in the innate immune response of all living organisms. Their action mechanism does not depend on the presence of protein receptors, but on their ability to target and disrupt the membranes of a wide range of pathogenic and pathologic cells which are recognized by their specific compositions, typically with a relatively high concentration of anionic lipids. Lipid profile singularities have been found in cancer, inflammation, bacteria, viral infections, and even in senescent cells, enabling the possibility to use them as therapeutic targets and/or diagnostic biomarkers. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are extraordinarily well suited to explore how HDPs interact with membrane models, providing a large amount of qualitative and quantitative information that, nowadays, cannot be assessed by wet-lab methods at the same level of temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we present SuPepMem, an open-access repository containing MD simulations of different natural and artificial peptides with potential membrane lysis activity, interacting with membrane models of healthy mammal, bacteria, viruses, cancer or senescent cells. In addition to a description of the HDPs and the target systems, SuPepMem provides both the input files necessary to run the simulations and also the results of some selected analyses, including structural and MD-based quantitative descriptors. These descriptors are expected to be useful to train machine learning algorithms that could contribute to design new therapeutic peptides. Tools for comparative analysis between different HDPs and model membranes, as well as to restrict the queries to structural and time-averaged properties are also available. SuPepMem is a living project, that will continuously grow with more simulations including peptides of different sequences, MD simulations with different number of peptide units, more membrane models and also several resolution levels. The database is open to MD simulations from other users (after quality check by the SuPepMem team).

"35562840","SynLethDB 2.0: a web-based knowledge graph database on synthetic lethality for novel anticancer drug discovery. Two genes are synthetic lethal if mutations in both genes result in impaired cell viability, while mutation of either gene does not affect the cell survival. The potential usage of synthetic lethality (SL) in anticancer therapeutics has attracted many researchers to identify synthetic lethal gene pairs. To include newly identified SLs and more related knowledge, we present a new version of the SynLethDB database to facilitate the discovery of clinically relevant SLs.

"38022524","The SYSCID map: a graphical and computational resource of molecular mechanisms across rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are thought to emerge from an impaired complex network of inter- and intracellular biochemical interactions among several proteins and small chemical compounds under strong influence of genetic and environmental factors. CIDs are characterised by shared and disease-specific processes, which is reflected by partially overlapping genetic risk maps and pathogenic cells (e.g., T cells). Their pathogenesis involves a plethora of intracellular pathways. The translation of the research findings on CIDs molecular mechanisms into effective treatments is challenging and may explain the low remission rates despite modern targeted therapies. Modelling CID-related causal interactions as networks allows us to tackle the complexity at a systems level and improve our understanding of the interplay of key pathways. Here we report the construction, description, and initial applications of the SYSCID map (https://syscid.elixir-luxembourg.org/), a mechanistic causal interaction network covering the molecular crosstalk between IBD, RA and SLE. We demonstrate that the map serves as an interactive, graphical review of IBD, RA and SLE molecular mechanisms, and helps to understand the complexity of omics data. Examples of such application are illustrated using transcriptome data from time-series gene expression profiles following anti-TNF treatment and data from genome-wide associations studies that enable us to suggest potential effects to altered pathways and propose possible mechanistic biomarkers of treatment response.","11/1/2023","http://syscid.elixir-luxembourg.org","SYSCID",0.977180063724518,"",0,"SYSCID",0.977180064,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"34534340","PlantGSAD: a comprehensive gene set annotation database for plant species. With the accumulation of massive data sets from high-throughput experiments and the rapid emergence of new types of omics data, gene sets have become more diverse and essential for the refinement of gene annotation at multidimensional levels. Accordingly, we collected and defined 236 007 gene sets across different categories for 44 plant species in the Plant Gene Set Annotation Database (PlantGSAD). These gene sets were divided into nine main categories covering many functional subcategories, such as trait ontology, co-expression modules, chromatin states, and liquid-liquid phase separation. The annotations from the collected gene sets covered all of the genes in the Brassicaceae species Arabidopsis and Poaceae species Oryza sativa. Several GSEA tools are implemented in PlantGSAD to improve the efficiency of the analysis, including custom SEA for a flexible strategy based on customized annotations, SEACOMPARE for the cross-comparison of SEA results, and integrated visualization features for ontological analysis that intuitively reflects their parent-child relationships. In summary, PlantGSAD provides numerous gene sets for multiple plant species and highly efficient analysis tools. We believe that PlantGSAD will become a multifunctional analysis platform that can be used to predict and elucidate the functions and mechanisms of genes of interest.

Rapidly appearing SARS-CoV-2 mutations can affect T cell epitopes, which can help the virus to evade either CD8 or CD4 T-cell responses. We developed T-cell COVID-19 Atlas (T-CoV, https://t-cov.hse.ru) - the comprehensive web portal, which allows one to analyze how SARS-CoV-2 mutations alter the presentation of viral peptides by HLA molecules. The data are presented for common virus variants and the most frequent HLA class I and class II alleles. Binding affinities of HLA molecules and viral peptides were assessed with accurate in silico methods. The obtained results highlight the importance of taking HLA alleles diversity into account: mutation-mediated alterations in HLA-peptide interactions were highly dependent on HLA alleles. For example, we found that the essential number of peptides tightly bound to HLA-B*07:02 in the reference Wuhan variant ceased to be tight binders for the Indian (Delta) and the UK (Alpha) variants. In summary, we believe that T-CoV will help researchers and clinicians to predict the susceptibility of individuals with different HLA genotypes to infection with variants of SARS-CoV-2 and/or forecast its severity.","1/1/2022","http://t-cov.hse.ru","T-CoV",0.997746384143829,"T-cell COVID-19 Atlas",0.767939195036888,"T-CoV",0.997746384,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Introduction Recent advances in generating massive single-cell/nucleus transcriptomic data have shown great potential for facilitating the identification of cell type-specific Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathobiology and drug-target discovery for therapeutic development. Methods We developed The Alzheimer's Cell Atlas (TACA) by compiling an AD brain cell atlas consisting of over 1.1 million cells/nuclei across 26 data sets, covering major brain regions (hippocampus, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, and so on) and cell types (astrocyte, microglia, neuron, oligodendrocytes, and so on). We conducted nearly 1400 differential expression comparisons to identify cell type-specific molecular alterations (e.g., case vs healthy control, sex-specific, apolipoprotein E (APOE) √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬é√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬µ4/√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬é√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬µ4, and TREM2 mutations). Each comparison was followed by protein-protein interaction module detection, functional enrichment analysis, and omics-informed target and drug (over 700,000 perturbation profiles) screening. Over 400 cell-cell interaction analyses using 6000 ligand-receptor interactions were conducted to identify the cell-cell communication networks in AD. Results All results are integrated into TACA (https://taca.lerner.ccf.org/), a new web portal with cell type-specific, abundant transcriptomic information, and 12 interactive visualization tools for AD. Discussion We envision that TACA will be a highly valuable resource for both basic and translational research in AD, as it provides abundant information for AD pathobiology and actionable systems biology tools for drug discovery. Highlights We compiled an Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain cell atlas consisting of more than 1.1 million cells/nuclei transcriptomes from 26 data sets, covering major brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and cell types (e.g., neuron, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and microglia).We conducted over 1400 differential expression (DE) comparisons to identify cell type-specific gene expression alterations.

"35687095","The Ocean Gene Atlas v2.0: online exploration of the biogeography and phylogeny of plankton genes. Testing hypothesis about the biogeography of genes using large data resources such as Tara Oceans marine metagenomes and metatranscriptomes requires significant hardware resources and programming skills. The new release of the 'Ocean Gene Atlas' (OGA2) is a freely available intuitive online service to mine large and complex marine environmental genomic databases. OGA2 datasets available have been extended and now include, from the Tara Oceans portfolio: (i) eukaryotic Metagenome-Assembled-Genomes (MAGs) and Single-cell Assembled Genomes (SAGs) (10.2E+6 coding genes), (ii) version 2 of Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalogue (46.8E+6 non-redundant genes), (iii) 924 MetaGenomic Transcriptomes (7E+6 unigenes), (iv) 530 MAGs from an Arctic MAG catalogue (1E+6 genes) and (v) 1888 Bacterial and Archaeal Genomes (4.5E+6 genes), and an additional dataset from the Malaspina 2010 global circumnavigation: (vi) 317 Malaspina Deep Metagenome Assembled Genomes (0.9E+6 genes). Novel analyses enabled by OGA2 include phylogenetic tree inference to visualize user queries within their context of sequence homologues from both the marine environmental dataset and the RefSeq database. An Application Programming Interface (API) now allows users to query OGA2 using command-line tools, hence providing local workflow integration. Finally, gene abundance can be interactively filtered directly on map displays using any of the available environmental variables.

"37427797","TarpiD, a database of putative and validated targets of piRNAs. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a novel class of 18-36 nts long small non-coding single-stranded RNAs that play crucial roles in a wide array of critical biological activities besides maintaining genome integrity by transposon silencing. piRNAs influence biological processes and pathways by regulating gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Studies have reported that piRNAs silence various endogenous genes post-transcriptionally by binding to respective mRNAs through interaction with the PIWI proteins. Several thousands of piRNAs have been discovered in animals, but their functions remain largely undiscovered owing to a lack of proper guiding principles of piRNA targeting or diversity in targeting patterns amongst piRNAs from the same or different species. Identification of piRNA targets is essential for deciphering their functions. There are a few tools and databases on piRNAs, but there are no systematic and exclusive repositories to obtain information on target genes regulated by piRNAs and other related information. Hence, we developed a user-friendly database named TarpiD (Targets of piRNA Database) that offers comprehensive information on piRNA and its targets, including their expression, methodologies (high-throughput or low-throughput) for target identification/validation, cells/tissue types, diseases, target gene regulation types, target binding regions, and key functions driven by piRNAs through target gene interactions. The contents of TarpiD are curated from the published literature and enable users to search and download the targets of a particular piRNA or the piRNAs that target a specific gene for use in their research.

This provides a resource for investigating molecular-level cancer etiologies using clinical correlations. Although cancers often arise from multiple genetic vulnerabilities and have deregulated gene sets (GSs), existing survival analysis protocols can report only on individual genes. Additionally, there is no systematic method to connect clinical outcomes with experimental (cell line) data. To address these gaps, we developed cSurvival (https://tau.cmmt.ubc.ca/cSurvival). cSurvival provides a user-adjustable analytical pipeline with a curated, integrated database and offers three main advances: (i) joint analysis with two genomic predictors to identify interacting biomarkers, including new algorithms to identify optimal cutoffs for two continuous predictors; (ii) survival analysis not only at the gene, but also the GS level; and (iii) integration of clinical and experimental cell line studies to generate synergistic biological insights. To demonstrate these advances, we report three case studies. We confirmed findings of autophagy-dependent survival in colorectal cancers and of synergistic negative effects between high expression of SLC7A11 and SLC2A1 on outcomes in several cancers. We further used cSurvival to identify high expression of the Nrf2-antioxidant response element pathway as a main indicator for lung cancer prognosis and for cellular resistance to oxidative stress-inducing drugs. Altogether, these analyses demonstrate cSurvival's ability to support biomarker prognosis and interaction analysis via gene- and GS-level approaches and to integrate clinical and experimental biomedical studies.","5/1/2022","http://tau.cmmt.ubc.ca/cSurvival","cSurvival",0.996174812316894,"",0,"cSurvival",0.996174812,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36587232","TCMSID: a simplified integrated database for drug discovery from traditional chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases for millennia. In the modernization process of TCM, TCM ingredient databases are playing more and more important roles. However, most of the existing TCM ingredient databases do not provide simplification function for extracting key ingredients in each herb or formula, which hinders the research on the mechanism of actions of the ingredients in TCM databases. The lack of quality control and standardization of the data in most of these existing databases is also a prominent disadvantage. Therefore, we developed a Traditional Chinese Medicine Simplified Integrated Database (TCMSID) with high storage, high quality and standardization. The database includes 499 herbs registered in the Chinese pharmacopeia with 20,015 ingredients, 3270 targets as well as corresponding detailed information. TCMSID is not only a database of herbal ingredients, but also a TCM simplification platform. Key ingredients from TCM herbs are available to be screened out and regarded as representatives to explore the mechanism of TCM herbs by implementing multi-tool target prediction and multilevel network construction. TCMSID provides abundant data sources and analysis platforms for TCM simplification and drug discovery, which is expected to promote modernization and internationalization of TCM and enhance its international status in the future.

We have developed the underrepresented post-translational modification (PTM) database (urPTMdb), a PTM gene set database to accelerate the discovery of enriched protein modifications in experimental data. urPTMdb provides curated lists of proteins reported to be substrates of underrepresented modifications. Their enrichment in proteomics datasets can reveal unexpected PTM regulations. urPTMdb can be implemented in existing workflows, or used in TeaProt, an online Shiny tool that integrates upstream transcription factor enrichment analysis with downstream pathway analysis through an easy-to-use interactive interface. TeaProt annotates user-uploaded data with drug-gene interactions, subcellular localizations, phenotypic functions, gene-disease associations, and enzyme-gene interactions. TeaProt enables gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to discover enrichments in gene sets from various resources, including MSigDB, CHEA, and urPTMdb. We demonstrate the utility of urPTMdb and TeaProt through the analysis of a previously published Western diet-induced remodeling of the tongue proteome, which revealed altered cellular processes associated with energy metabolism, interferon alpha/gamma response, adipogenesis, HMGylation substrate enrichment, and transcription regulation through PPARG and CEBPA.

"36350663","TEDD: a database of temporal gene expression patterns during multiple developmental periods in human and model organisms. Characterization of the specific expression and chromatin profiles of genes enables understanding how they contribute to tissue/organ development and the mechanisms leading to diseases. Whilst the number of single-cell sequencing studies is increasing dramatically; however, data mining and reanalysis remains challenging. Herein, we systematically curated the up-to-date and most comprehensive datasets of sequencing data originating from 2760 bulk samples and over 5.1 million single-cells from multiple developmental periods from humans and multiple model organisms. With unified and systematic analysis, we profiled the gene expression and chromatin accessibility among 481 cell-types, 79 tissue-types and 92 timepoints, and pinpointed cells with the co-expression of target genes. We also enabled the detection of gene(s) with a temporal and cell-type specific expression profile that is similar to or distinct from that of a target gene. Additionally, we illustrated the potential upstream and downstream gene-gene regulation interactions, particularly under the same biological process(es) or KEGG pathway(s). Thus, TEDD (Temporal Expression during Development Database), a value-added database with a user-friendly interface, not only enables researchers to identify cell-type/tissue-type specific and temporal gene expression and chromatin profiles but also facilitates the association of genes with undefined biological functions in development and diseases.

"36170113","TEx-MST: tissue expression profiles of MANE select transcripts. Recently, a new reference transcript dataset [Matched Annotation from the NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) select] was released by NCBI and EMBL-EBI to make available a new unified representative transcript for human protein-coding genes. While the main purpose of MANE project is to provide a harmonized gene and transcript information standard, there is no explicit tissue expression information about these MANE select transcripts. In this report, we tried to provide useful expression profiles of MANE select transcripts in various normal human tissues to allow further interrogation of their molecular modulations and functional significance. We obtained the new V9 transcript expression dataset from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) web portal. This new GTEx dataset, based on a long-read sequencing platform, affords better assessment of the expression of alternative spliced transcripts. This tissue expression profiles of MANE select transcripts (TEx-MST) database not only provides the basic information of MANE select transcripts but also tissue expression profiles on alternative transcripts in protein-coding genes. Users can initiate the interrogation by gene symbol searches or by browsing the MANE genes with various criteria (such as genome locations or expression rankings). We further utilized the GENCODE biotype feature to identify the top-ranked protein-coding transcripts by choosing the most expressed protein-coding transcripts from GTEx datasets (both V8 and V9 datasets).

"36200824","TFSyntax: a database of transcription factors binding syntax in mammalian genomes. In mammals, transcriptional factors (TFs) drive gene expression by binding to regulatory elements in a cooperative manner. Deciphering the rules of such cooperation is crucial to obtain a full understanding of cellular homeostasis and development. Although this is a long-standing topic, there is no comprehensive database for biologists to access the syntax of TF binding sites. Here we present TFSyntax (https://tfsyntax.zhaopage.com), a database focusing on the arrangement of TF binding sites. TFSyntax maps the binding motif of 1299 human TFs and 890 mouse TFs across 382 cells and tissues, representing the most comprehensive TF binding map to date. In addition to location, TFSyntax defines motif positional preference, density and colocalization within accessible elements. Powered by a series of functional modules based on web interface, users can freely search, browse, analyze, and download data of interest. With comprehensive characterization of TF binding syntax across distinct tissues and cell types, TFSyntax represents a valuable resource and platform for studying the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and exploring how regulatory DNA variants cause disease.","1/1/2023","http://tfsyntax.zhaopage.com","TFSyntax",0.99810928106308,"",0,"TFSyntax",0.998109281,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"35950764","The HPV Induced Cancer Resource (THInCR): a Suite of Tools for Investigating HPV-Dependent Human Carcinogenesis. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are highly infectious and cause the most common sexually transmitted viral infections. They induce hyperproliferation of squamous epithelial tissue, often forming warts. Virally encoded proteins reprogram gene expression and cell growth to create an optimal environment for viral replication. In addition to their normal roles in infection, functional alterations induced by viral proteins establish conditions that frequently contribute to human carcinogenesis. In fact, ~5% of human cancers are caused by HPVs, with virtually all cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CESC) and an increasing number of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSC) attributed to HPV infection. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecularly characterized thousands of primary human cancer samples in many cancer types, including CESC and HNSC, and created a comprehensive atlas of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data. This publicly available genome-wide information provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand the knowledge of the role that HPV plays in human carcinogenesis. While many tools exist to mine these data, few, if any, focus on the comparison of HPV-positive cancers with their HPV-negative counterparts or adjacent normal control tissue. We have constructed a suite of web-based tools, The HPV Induced Cancer Resource (THInCR), to utilize TCGA data for research related to HPV-induced CESC and HNSC. These tools allow investigators to gain greater biological and medical insights by exploring the impacts of HPV on cellular gene expression (mRNA and microRNA), altered gene methylation, and associations with patient survival and immune landscape features. These tools are accessible at https://thincr.ca/. IMPORTANCE The suite of analytical tools of THInCR provides the opportunity to investigate the roles that candidate target genes identified in cell lines or other model systems contribute to in actual HPV-dependent human cancers and is based on large-scale TCGA data sets. Expression of target genes, including both mRNA and microRNA, can be correlated with HPV gene expression, epigenetic changes in DNA methylation, patient survival, and numerous immune features, like leukocyte infiltration, interferon gamma response, T cell response, etc. Data from these analyses may immediately provide evidence to validate in vitro observations, reveal insights into mechanisms of virus-mediated alterations in cell growth, behavior, gene expression, and innate and adaptive immunity and may help hypothesis generation for further investigations.","8/11/2022","http://thincr.ca","THInCR",0.995705485343933,"The HPV Induced Cancer Resource",0.916564643383026,"THInCR",0.995705485,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36399488","TIMEDB: tumor immune micro-environment cell composition database with automatic analysis and interactive visualization. Deciphering the cell-type composition in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) can significantly increase the efficacy of cancer treatment and improve the prognosis of cancer. Such a task has benefited from microarrays and RNA sequencing technologies, which have been widely adopted in cancer studies, resulting in extensive expression profiles with clinical phenotypes across multiple cancers. Current state-of-the-art tools can infer cell-type composition from bulk expression profiles, providing the possibility of investigating the inter-heterogeneity and intra-heterogeneity of TIME across cancer types. Much can be gained from these tools in conjunction with a well-curated database of TIME cell-type composition data, accompanied by the corresponding clinical information. However, currently available databases fall short in data volume, multi-platform dataset integration, and tool integration.

"37566336","The Children's Picture Books Lexicon (CPB-LEX): A large-scale lexical database from children's picture books. This article presents CPB-LEX, a large-scale database of lexical statistics derived from children's picture books (age range 0-8 years). Such a database is essential for research in psychology, education and computational modelling, where rich details on the vocabulary of early print exposure are required. CPB-LEX was built through an innovative method of computationally extracting lexical information from automatic speech-to-text captions and subtitle tracks generated from social media channels dedicated to reading picture books aloud. It consists of approximately 25,585 types (wordforms) and their frequency norms (raw and Zipf-transformed), a lexicon of bigrams (two-word sequences and their transitional probabilities) and a document-term matrix (which shows the importance of each word in the corpus in each book). Several immediate contributions of CPB-LEX to behavioural science research are reported, including that the new CPB-LEX frequency norms strongly predict age of acquisition and outperform comparable child-input lexical databases. The database allows researchers and practitioners to extract lexical statistics for high-frequency words which can be used to develop word lists. The paper concludes with an investigation of how CPB-LEX can be used to extend recent modelling research on the lexical diversity children receive from picture books in addition to child-directed speech. Our model shows that the vocabulary input from a relatively small number of picture books can dramatically enrich vocabulary exposure from child-directed speech and potentially assist children with vocabulary input deficits.

"37646937","PlanTEnrichment: A How-to Guide on Rapid Identification of Transposable Elements Associated with Regions of Interest in Select Plant Genomes. Transposable elements (TEs) are repeat elements that can relocate or create novel copies of themselves in the genome and contribute to genomic complexity and expansion, via events such as chromosome recombination or regulation of gene expression. However, given the large number of such repeats across the genome, identifying repeats of interest can be a challenge in even well-annotated genomes, especially in more complex, TE-rich plant genomes. Here, we describe a protocol for PlanTEnrichment, a database we created comprising information on 11 plant genomes to analyze stress-associated TEs using publicly available data. By selecting a genome and providing a list of genes or genomic regions whose TE associations the user wants to identify, the user can rapidly obtain TE subfamilies found near the provided regions, as well as their superfamily and class, and the enrichment values of the repeats. The results also provide the locations of individual repeat instances found, alongside the input regions or genes they are associated with, and a bar graph of the top ten most significant repeat subfamilies identified. PlanTEnrichment is freely available at http://tools.ibg.deu.edu.tr/plantenrichment/ and can be used by researchers with rudimentary or no proficiency in computational analysis of TE elements, allowing for expedience in the identification of TEs of interest and helping further our understanding of the potential contributions of TEs in plant genomes.","1/1/2023","http://tools.ibg.deu.edu.tr/plantenrichment","PlanTEnrichment",0.994290053844452,"",0,"PlanTEnrichment",0.994290054,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"38323044","Trainingspace: Neuroeducation Without Borders. Advancements in the field of neuroinformatics have resulted in a massive explosion of raw data of many varieties, yet many traditional neuroscience training programs have not changed their curricula to reflect the urgent need for improved computational skills that would enable trainees to handle, organize, and interrogate such large, multimodal datasets. Thus, the objective of this project was to build an open access hub of neuroscience educational resources to fill the gap between current neuroscience curricula and the computationally focused skillset required to work with big data. To achieve this aim, we invited representatives from the world's leading neuroscience societies and large-scale brain initiatives to form the INCF Training and Education Committee that would provide oversight over the content and capabilities of the online hub. As a result, we developed TrainingSpace (https://training.incf.org/), an open access hub of nearly 500 multimedia courses, lectures, and tool tutorials covering the subspecialisms of neuroscience and neuroinformatics, as well as computer science, data science, and ethics. In addition to course content, TrainingSpace also provides users with access to publicly available datasets through KnowledgeSpace, a discoverability portal and community encyclopedia for neuroscience, as well as a question and answer forum, Neurostars.org. Since its launch in 2019, TrainingSpace has steadily increased in popularity with both trainees and trainers alike. It has also become popular with content providers that want to make their training materials available to the neuroscience community-at-large, as well as integrate their content into the larger TrainingSpace ecosystem.","6/1/2022","http://training.incf.org","TrainingSpace",0.991692662239075,"",0,"TrainingSpace",0.991692662,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37657924","TICBase: Integrated Resource for Data on Drug and Environmental Chemical Interactions with Mammalian Drug Transporters. Environmental health science seeks to predict how environmental toxins, chemical toxicants, and prescription drugs accumulate and interact within the body. Xenobiotic transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) superfamilies are major determinants of the uptake and disposition of xenobiotics across the kingdoms of life. The goal of this study was to integrate drug and environmental chemical interactions of mammalian ABC and SLC proteins in a centralized, integrative database. We built upon an existing publicly accessible platform-the ""TransPortal""-which was updated with novel data and searchable features on transporter-interfering chemicals from manually curated literature data. The integrated resource TransPortal-TICBase (https://transportal.compbio.ucsf.edu) now contains information on 46 different mammalian xenobiotic transporters of the ABC- and SLC-type superfamilies, including 13 newly added rodent and 2 additional human drug transporters, 126 clinical drug-drug interactions, and a more than quadrupled expansion of the initial in vitro chemical interaction data from 1,402 to 6,296 total interactions. Based on our updated database, environmental interference with major human and rodent drug transporters occurs across the ABC- and SLC-type superfamilies, with kinetics indicating that some chemicals, such as the ionic liquid 1-hexylpyridinium chloride and the antiseptic chlorhexidine, can act as strong inhibitors with potencies similar or even higher than pharmacological model inhibitors. The new integrated web portal serves as a central repository of current and emerging data for interactions of prescription drugs and environmental chemicals with human drug transporters. This archive has important implications for predicting adverse drug-drug and drug-environmental chemical interactions and can serve as a reference website for the broader scientific community of clinicians and researchers.","9/12/2023","http://transportal.compbio.ucsf.edu","TICBase",0.979234576225281,"",0,"TICBase",0.979234576,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37223317","TRIPBASE: a database for identifying the human genomic DNA and lncRNA triplexes. Long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as RNA sequences which are >200 nt with no coding capacity. These lncRNAs participate in various biological mechanisms, and are widely abundant in a diversity of species. There is well-documented evidence that lncRNAs can interact with genomic DNAs by forming triple helices (triplexes). Previously, several computational methods have been designed based on the Hoogsteen base-pair rule to find theoretical RNA-DNA:DNA triplexes. While powerful, these methods suffer from a high false-positive rate between the predicted triplexes and the biological experiments. To address this issue, we first collected the experimental data of genomic RNA-DNA triplexes from antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated capture assays and used Triplexator, the most widely used tool for lncRNA-DNA interaction, to reveal the intrinsic information on true triplex binding potential. Based on the analysis, we proposed six computational attributes as filters to improve the in-silico triplex prediction by removing most false positives. Further, we have built a new database, TRIPBASE, as the first comprehensive collection of genome-wide triplex predictions of human lncRNAs. In TRIPBASE, the user interface allows scientists to apply customized filtering criteria to access the potential triplexes of human lncRNAs in the cis-regulatory regions of the human genome.

"37159240","TRSRD: a database for research on risky substances in tea using natural language processing and knowledge graph-based techniques. During the production and processing of tea, harmful substances are often introduced. However, they have never been systematically integrated, and it is impossible to understand the harmful substances that may be introduced during tea production and their related relationships when searching for papers. To address these issues, a database on tea risk substances and their research relationships was constructed. These data were correlated by knowledge mapping techniques, and a Neo4j graph database centered on tea risk substance research was constructed, containing 4189 nodes and 9400 correlations (e.g. research category-PMID, risk substance category-PMID, and risk substance-PMID). This is the first knowledge-based graph database that is specifically designed for integrating and analyzing risk substances in tea and related research, containing nine main types of tea risk substances (including a comprehensive discussion of inclusion pollutants, heavy metals, pesticides, environmental pollutants, mycotoxins, microorganisms, radioactive isotopes, plant growth regulators, and others) and six types of tea research papers (including reviews, safety evaluations/risk assessments, prevention and control measures, detection methods, residual/pollution situations, and data analysis/data measurement).

"38097965","Twnbiome: a public database of the healthy Taiwanese gut microbiome. With new advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technology at reduced costs, research on bacterial genomes in the environment has become affordable. Compared to traditional methods, NGS provides high-throughput sequencing reads and the ability to identify many species in the microbiome that were previously unknown. Numerous bioinformatics tools and algorithms have been developed to conduct such analyses. However, in order to obtain biologically meaningful results, the researcher must select the proper tools and combine them to construct an efficient pipeline. This complex procedure may include tens of tools, each of which require correct parameter settings. Furthermore, an NGS data analysis involves multiple series of command-line tools and requires extensive computational resources, which imposes a high barrier for biologists and clinicians to conduct NGS analysis and even interpret their own data. Therefore, we established a public gut microbiome database, which we call Twnbiome, created using healthy subjects from Taiwan, with the goal of enabling microbiota research for the Taiwanese population.

Here, to meet the urgent requirement of proteome-wide E3/deubiquitinase-substrate interactions (ESIs/DSIs) in multiple organisms, we updated UbiBrowser to version 2.0 (http://ubibrowser.ncpsb.org.cn). Using an improved protocol, we collected 4068/967 known ESIs/DSIs by manual curation, and we predicted about 2.2 million highly confident ESIs/DSIs in 39 organisms, with√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†>210-fold increase in total data volume. In addition, we made several new features in the updated version: (i) it allows exploring proteins' upstream E3 ligases and deubiquitinases simultaneously; (ii) it has significantly increased species coverage; (iii) it presents a uniform confidence scoring system to rank predicted ESIs/DSIs. To facilitate the usage of UbiBrowser 2.0, we also redesigned the web interface for exploring these known and predicted ESIs/DSIs, and added functions of 'Browse', 'Download' and 'Application Programming Interface'. We believe that UbiBrowser 2.0, as a discovery tool, will contribute to the study of protein ubiquitination and the development of drug targets for complex diseases.","1/1/2022","http://ubibrowser.ncpsb.org.cn","UbiBrowser",0.994302034378052,"",0,"UbiBrowser",0.994302034,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Unlike conventional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules reactive T cells, the unconventional T cell subpopulations recognize various non-polymorphic antigen-presenting molecules and are typically characterized by simplified patterns of T cell receptors (TCRs), rapid effector responses and 'public' antigen specificities. Dissecting the recognition patterns of the non-MHC antigens by unconventional TCRs can help us further our understanding of the unconventional T cell immunity. The small size and irregularities of the released unconventional TCR sequences are far from high-quality to support systemic analysis of unconventional TCR repertoire.

"36271795","UFCG: database of universal fungal core genes and pipeline for genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of fungi. In phylogenomics the evolutionary relationship of organisms is studied by their genomic information. A common approach to phylogenomics is to extract related genes from each organism, build a multiple sequence alignment and then reconstruct evolution relations through a phylogenetic tree. Often a set of highly conserved genes occurring in single-copy, called core genes, are used for this analysis, as they allow efficient automation within a taxonomic clade. Here we introduce the Universal Fungal Core Genes (UFCG) database and pipeline for genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of fungi. The UFCG database consists of 61 curated fungal marker genes, including a novel set of 41 computationally derived core genes and 20 canonical genes derived from literature, as well as marker gene sequences extracted from publicly available fungal genomes. Furthermore, we provide an easy-to-use, fully automated and open-source pipeline for marker gene extraction, training and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The UFCG pipeline can identify marker genes from genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic data, while producing phylogenies consistent with those previously reported, and is publicly available together with the UFCG database at https://ufcg.steineggerlab.com.","1/1/2023","http://ufcg.steineggerlab.com","UFCG",0.960642218589783,"Universal Fungal Core Genes",0.94289594,"UFCG",0.960642219,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"34634815","SomaMutDB: a database of somatic mutations in normal human tissues. De novo mutations, a consequence of errors in DNA repair or replication, have been reported to accumulate with age in normal tissues of humans and model organisms. This accumulation during development and aging has been implicated as a causal factor in aging and age-related pathology, including but not limited to cancer. Due to their generally very low abundance mutations have been difficult to detect in normal tissues. Only with recent advances in DNA sequencing of single-cells, clonal lineages or ultra-high-depth sequencing of small tissue biopsies, somatic mutation frequencies and spectra have been unveiled in several tissue types. The rapid accumulation of such data prompted us to develop a platform called SomaMutDB (https://vijglab.einsteinmed.org/SomaMutDB) to catalog the 2.42 million single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 0.12 million small insertions and deletions (INDELs) thus far identified using these advanced methods in nineteen human tissues or cell types as a function of age or environmental stress conditions. SomaMutDB employs a user-friendly interface to display and query somatic mutations with their functional annotations. Moreover, the database provides six powerful tools for analyzing mutational signatures associated with the data. We believe such an integrated resource will prove valuable for understanding somatic mutations and their possible role in human aging and age-related diseases.","1/1/2022","http://vijglab.einsteinmed.org/SomaMutDB","SomaMutDB",0.997293531894684,"",0,"SomaMutDB",0.997293532,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37484460","The Viscum album Gene Space database. The hemiparasitic flowering plant Viscum album (European mistletoe) is known for its very special life cycle, extraordinary biochemical properties, and extremely large genome. The size of its genome is estimated to be 30 times larger than the human genome and 600 times larger than the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To achieve insights into the Gene Space of the genome, which is defined as the space including and surrounding protein-coding regions, a transcriptome project based on PacBio sequencing has recently been conducted. A database resulting from this project contains sequences of 39,092 different open reading frames encoding 32,064 distinct proteins. Based on 'Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs' (BUSCO) analysis, the completeness of the database was estimated to be in the range of 78%. To further develop this database, we performed a transcriptome project of V. album organs harvested in summer and winter based on Illumina sequencing. Data from both sequencing strategies were combined. The new V. album Gene Space database II (VaGs II) contains 90,039 sequences and has a completeness of 93% as revealed by BUSCO analysis. Sequences from other organisms, particularly fungi, which are known to colonize mistletoe leaves, have been removed. To evaluate the quality of the new database, proteome data of a mitochondrial fraction of V. album were re-analyzed. Compared to the original evaluation published five years ago, nearly 1000 additional proteins could be identified in the mitochondrial fraction, providing new insights into the Oxidative Phosphorylation System of V. album. The VaGs II database is available at https://viscumalbum.pflanzenproteomik.de/. Furthermore, all V. album sequences have been uploaded at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).","6/26/2023","http://viscumalbum.pflanzenproteomik.de","VaGs",0.849863688151042,"album Gene Space database",0.827408105,"VaGs",0.849863688,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"36852842","WASP: the World Archives of Species Perception. While human perception can play a role in influencing public support for species conservation, the mechanisms underlying human perception remain poorly understood. Some previous studies on perception have focused on a few specific taxa, which makes the understanding of the public perception of species at large a resource- and time-intensive task. Here, we introduce the World Archives of Species Perception project that consists of an animal survey and a plant survey to construct the first systematic database to study the human perception of the floral and faunal diversity at a global scale. We provide a description of our survey method, species selection, survey implementation and a discussion of the potential uses of our databases in multidisciplinary research. In the animal survey, we cover 1980 International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)-evaluated species, representing 25 classes, 192 orders, 1037 families and 1705 genera. In the plant survey, we cover 2000 IUCN-evaluated species, representing 13 classes, 93 orders, 386 families and 1968 genera.

"36495921","R-SIM: A Database of Binding Affinities for RNA-small Molecule Interactions. Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are involved in a multitude of crucial cellular functions by acting as a central conduit for information transfer. Due to their essential and versatile functional roles in the cell, RNAs have also been implicated in multiple disease conditions of therapeutic relevance including cancers, bacterial and viral infections and neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, several approaches have emerged to tap into the potentially unexplored regions of the druggable genome, which refers to the genes and gene products that are focused during drug development. For example, considering RNAs as viable alternative therapeutic targets for drug development can potentially expand the range of therapeutic targets. Consequently, the availability of adequate binding affinity measurements for RNA-small molecule interactions is essential to understand target selectivity and design more potent RNA-targeting drug-like molecules. To facilitate this growing need, we have curated a database of experimentally validated RNA-small molecule interactions, called RNA-Small molecule Interaction Miner (R-SIM). Each entry in R-SIM provides comprehensive information on sequence, structure and classification of the RNA target, various physicochemical properties of the small molecule, binding affinity value and corresponding experimental conditions, three-dimensional structure (experimental or modelled) of the RNA-small molecule complex, and the literature source for the data.

"36401317","MarineMetagenomeDB: a public repository for curated and standardized metadata for marine metagenomes. Background Metagenomics is an expanding field within microbial ecology, microbiology, and related disciplines. The number of metagenomes deposited in major public repositories such as Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and Metagenomic Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST) is rising exponentially. However, data mining and interpretation can be challenging due to mis-annotated and misleading metadata entries. In this study, we describe the Marine Metagenome Metadata Database (MarineMetagenomeDB) to help researchers identify marine metagenomes of interest for re-analysis and meta-analysis. To this end, we have manually curated the associated metadata of several thousands of microbial metagenomes currently deposited at SRA and MG-RAST. Results In total, 125 terms were curated according to 17 different classes (e.g., biome, material, oceanic zone, geographic feature√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†and oceanographic phenomena). Other standardized features include sample attributes (e.g., salinity, depth), sample location (e.g., latitude, longitude), and sequencing features (e.g., sequencing platform, sequence count). MarineMetagenomeDB version 1.0 contains 11,449 marine metagenomes from SRA and MG-RAST distributed across all oceans and several seas. Most samples were sequenced using Illumina sequencing technology (84.33%). More than 55% of the samples were collected from the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. About 40% of the samples had their biomes assigned as 'ocean'. The 'Quick Search' and 'Advanced Search' tabs allow users to use different filters to select samples of interest dynamically in the web app. The interactive map allows the visualization of samples based on their location on the world map. The web app is also equipped with a novel download tool (on both Windows and Linux operating systems), that allows easy download of raw sequence data of selected samples from their respective repositories.

"36646374","psnGPCRdb: The Structure-network Database of G Protein Coupled Receptors. G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical eukaryotic signal transduction gatekeepers and represent the largest protein superfamily in the human proteome, with more than 800 members. They share seven transmembrane helices organized in an up-down bundle architecture. GPCR-mediated signaling pathways have been linked to numerous human diseases, and GPCRs are the targets of approximately 35% of all drugs currently on the market. Structure network analysis, a graph theory-based approach, represents a cutting-edge tool to deeply understand GPCR function, which strongly relies on communication between the extracellular and intracellular poles of their structure. psnGPCRdb stores the structure networks (i.e., linked nodes, hubs, communities and communication pathways) computed on all updated GPCR structures in the Protein Data Bank, in their isolated states or in complex with extracellular and/or intracellular molecules. The structure communication signatures of a sub-family or family of GPCRs as well as of their small-molecule activators or inhibitors are stored as consensus networks. The database stores also all meaningful structure network-based comparisons (i.e., difference networks) of functionally different states (i.e., inactive or active) of a given receptor sub-type, or of consensus networks representative of a receptor sub-type, type, sub-family or family. Single or consensus GPCR networks hold also information on amino acid conservation. The database allows to graphically analyze 3D structure networks together with interactive data-tables. Ligand-centric networks can be analyzed as well. psnGPCRdb is unique and represents a powerful resource to unravel GPCR function with important implications in cell signaling and drug design. psnGPCRdb is freely available at: http://webpsn.hpc.unimo.it/psngpcr.php.","1/13/2023","http://webpsn.hpc.unimo.it/psngpcr.php","psnGPCRdb",0.996151804924011,"",0,"psnGPCRdb",0.996151805,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Background Bacterial diseases are one of the leading causes of millions of fatalities worldwide, mainly due to antimicrobial resistance. The discovery of chicken cholera vaccine in 1879 revolutionized our fight against bacterial infections. Bacterial vaccines are proven to be highly effective in preventing many infectious diseases. Currently, various licensed vaccines are available against bacterial infections such as typhoid, diphtheria, cholera and tetanus in the market. In this study, we have attempted to compile different information regarding bacterial vaccines, their types, efficacy, mechanism of action, status, route of administration and other relevant details as a knowledgebase known as BacVacDB. Methods BacVacDB was implemented using Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. HTML, PHP, CSS and Javascript have been used to develop the front end and MySQL for the back end. The data was curated from several sources, including literature, databases and relevant web resources. Results This paper reviewed 371 vaccines against 30 human bacterial diseases maintained in BacVacDB, of which 167 are approved and 204 in clinical trials. This database provides the users an effortless search facility in the four modules, 'Search,' 'Browse,' 'External Links' and 'General Information'.

"37678708","WebSTR: A Population-wide Database of Short Tandem Repeat Variation in Humans. Short tandem repeats (STRs) are consecutive repetitions of one to six nucleotide motifs. They are hypervariable due to the high prevalence of repeat unit insertions or deletions primarily caused by polymerase slippage during replication. Genetic variation at STRs has been shown to influence a range of traits in humans, including gene expression, cancer risk, and autism. Until recently STRs have been poorly studied since they pose significant challenges to bioinformatics analyses. Moreover, genome-wide analysis of STR variation in population-scale cohorts requires large amounts of data and computational resources. However, the recent advent of genome-wide analysis tools has resulted in multiple large genome-wide datasets of STR variation spanning nearly two million genomic loci in thousands of individuals from diverse populations. Here we present WebSTR, a database of genetic variation and other characteristics of genome-wide STRs across human populations. WebSTR is based on reference panels of more than 1.7 million human STRs created with state of the art repeat annotation methods and can easily be extended to include additional cohorts or species. It currently contains data based on STR genotypes for individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project, H3Africa, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project and colorectal cancer patients from the TCGA dataset.

"37919660","Exploring microproteins from various model organisms using the mip-mining database. Microproteins, prevalent across all kingdoms of life, play a crucial role in cell physiology and human health. Although global gene transcription is widely explored and abundantly available, our understanding of microprotein functions using transcriptome data is still limited. To mitigate this problem, we present a database, Mip-mining ( https://weilab.sjtu.edu.cn/mipmining/ ), underpinned by high-quality RNA-sequencing data exclusively aimed at analyzing microprotein functions. The Mip-mining hosts 336 sets of high-quality transcriptome data from 8626 samples and nine representative living organisms, including microorganisms, plants, animals, and humans, in our Mip-mining database. Our database specifically provides a focus on a range of diseases and environmental stress conditions, taking into account chemical, physical, biological, and diseases-related stresses. Comparatively, our platform enables customized analysis by inputting desired data sets with self-determined cutoff values. The practicality of Mip-mining is demonstrated by identifying essential microproteins in different species and revealing the importance of ATP15 in the acetic acid stress tolerance of budding yeast. We believe that Mip-mining will facilitate a greater understanding and application of microproteins in biotechnology.

"36799723","The Glycan Structure Dictionary-a dictionary describing commonly used glycan structure terms. Recent technological advances in glycobiology have resulted in a large influx of data and the publication of many papers describing discoveries in glycoscience. However, the terms used in describing glycan structural features are not standardized, making it difficult to harmonize data across biomolecular databases, hampering the harvesting of information across studies and hindering text mining and curation efforts. To address this shortcoming, the Glycan Structure Dictionary has been developed as a reference dictionary to provide a standardized list of widely used glycan terms that can help in the curation and mapping of glycan structures described in publications. Currently, the dictionary has 190 glycan structure terms with 297 synonyms linked to 3,332 publications. For a term to be included in the dictionary, it must be present in at least 2 peer-reviewed publications. Synonyms, annotations, and cross-references to GlyTouCan, GlycoMotif, and other relevant databases and resources are also provided when available. The purpose of this effort is to facilitate biocuration, assist in the development of text mining tools, improve the harmonization of search, and browse capabilities in glycoinformatics resources and help to map glycan structures to function and disease.

"34432052","3'aQTL-atlas: an atlas of 3'UTR alternative polyadenylation quantitative trait loci across human normal tissues. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human traits and diseases. However, functional interpretation of these SNPs remains a significant challenge. Our recent study established the concept of 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) alternative polyadenylation (APA) quantitative trait loci (3'aQTLs), which can be used to interpret √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬à√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬º16.1% of GWAS SNPs and are distinct from gene expression QTLs and splicing QTLs.

"35636406","Creation of an Electronic Resource Repository for Differences of Sex Development (DSD): Collaboration Between Advocates and Clinicians in the DSD-Translational Research Network. Introduction People with differences of sex development (DSD) and their families need education about these conditions while receiving emotional and peer support to participate in shared decision-making, reduce social isolation, and optimize physical and psychosocial outcomes. Barriers to education and support include limited knowledge and awareness by healthcare providers, tension among patient and medical communities, varied quality of educational resources, and the sensitive nature of DSD. We aimed to create an electronic repository of vetted quality online resources about DSD. Methods The electronic resource repository (e-RR) was a collaboration between affected individuals and advocates and healthcare providers in the DSD-Translational Research Network (DSD-TRN), an NIH-supported consortium of US teams committed to standardizing and optimizing care in DSD. The e-RR development and ongoing growth involved: (1) identification of resources by the project team (3 advocates and 1 physician), (2) evaluation and feedback by DSD-TRN clinical teams, (3) creation of the e-RR, and (4) review and revision. Twitter-like descriptions accompanied each entry; resources were categorized by target age, audience, and condition. Results Thirty-seven web-based educational, peer and advocacy support, and clinician-oriented resources were reviewed. Eight of 10 DSD-TRN teams responded to a survey regarding resource inclusion. Awareness of individual resources varied widely. Consensus was achieved when opinions differed; 30 resources were included. The e-RR is available online and as a downloadable booklet at http://www.accordalliance.org/resource-guide/. Conclusion The e-RR increases awareness of and access to vetted educational and support resources for those with DSD and healthcare providers. It represents important collaboration between advocates and providers.","5/30/2022","http://www.accordalliance.org/resource-guide","DSD",0.778234615921974,"Differences of Sex Development",0.698759689927101,"DSD",0.778234616,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""
"37279138","AADB: A Manually Collected Database for Combinations of Antibiotics With Adjuvants. Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern. The lack of innovations in antibiotic development has led to renewed interest in antibiotic adjuvants. However, there is no database to collect antibiotic adjuvants. Herein, we build a comprehensive database named Antibiotic Adjuvant DataBase (AADB) by manually collecting relevant literature. Specifically, AADB includes 3,035 combinations of antibiotics with adjuvants, covering 83 antibiotics, 226 adjuvants, and 325 bacterial strains. AADB provides user-friendly interfaces for searching and downloading. Users can easily obtain these datasets for further analysis. In addition, we also collected related datasets (e.g., chemogenomic and metabolomic data) and proposed a computational strategy to dissect these datasets. As a test case, we identified 10 candidates for minocycline, and 6 of 10 candidates are the known adjuvants that synergize with minocycline to inhibit the growth of E. coli BW25113.

"37120901","Anti Mtb Medicinal Plants Database (AMMPDB): A curated database of Indian anti-tubercular medicinal plants. The utilization of medicinal plants for their therapeutic properties has long been a key component of Indian culture. Unique medicinal characteristics can be found in the phytochemicals that are extracted from these plants. Globally, tuberculosis (TB) burden and management are challenged due to the emergence of new resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This highlights the importance of new drug molecules from diverse sources as well as their innovative management options. In this context, the present study formulated an Anti Mtb medicinal plant database (AMMPDB Ver. 1.1), a manually curated database of native Indian medicinal plants that reported anti-tubercular (anti-TB) activities and their potential therapeutic phytochemicals. This is the first-ever freely accessible digital repository. The current version of the database provides users, with information regarding 118 native Indian anti-tubercular medicinal plants and their 3374 phytochemicals. The database provides the following information: Taxonomical ID, botanical description, vernacular names, conservation status, geographical distribution maps, IC-50 value, phytochemical details which include - name, Compound ID, Synonyms, location in plant part, 2D, 3D structures (as per the availability), and their medicinal uses reported in the literature. The tools section of the database is equipped with sequentially catalogued and hyperlinked open-access tools utilized for computational drug designing. A case study has been incorporated under the contributors section to validate the tools section and the phytochemicals of the database.

"36299508","ArVirInd-a database of arboviral antigenic proteins from the Indian subcontinent. Background Studies on antigenic proteins for arboviruses are important for providing diagnostics and vaccine development. India and its neighboring countries have a huge burden of arboviral diseases. Data mining for country-specific sequences from existing bioinformatics databases is cumbersome and time-consuming. This necessitated the development of a database of antigenic proteins from arboviruses isolated from the countries of the Indian subcontinent. Methods Arboviral antigenic protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI and other databases. In silico antigenic characterization was performed (Epitope predictions) and data was incorporated into the database. The front end was designed and developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP. For the backend of the database, we have used MySQL. Results A database, named ArVirInd, is created as a repository of information on curated antigenic proteins. This enlists sequences by country and year of outbreak or origin of the viral strain. For each entry, antigenic information is provided along with functional sites, etc. Researchers can search this database by virus/protein name, country, and year of collection (or in combination) as well as peptide search for epitopes. It is available publicly via the Internet at http://www.arvirind.co.in. ArVirInd will be useful in the study of immune informatics, diagnostics, and vaccinology for arboviruses.","10/21/2022","http://www.arvirind.co.in","ArVirInd",0.996439158916473,"",0,"ArVirInd",0.996439159,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36653322","ENCD: a manually curated database of experimentally supported endocrine system disease and lncRNA associations. ENCD (http://www.bio-server.cn/ENCD/) is a manually curated database that provides comprehensive experimentally supported associations among endocrine system diseases (ESDs) and long non-coding ribonucleic acid (lncRNAs). The incidence of ESDs has increased in recent years, often accompanying other chronic diseases, and can lead to disability. A growing body of research suggests that lncRNA plays an important role in the progression and metastasis of ESDs. However, there are no resources focused on collecting and integrating the latest and experimentally supported lncRNA-ESD associations. Hence, we developed an ENCD database that consists of 1379 associations between 35 ESDs and 501 lncRNAs in 12 human tissues curated from literature. By using ENCD, users can explore the genetic data for diseases corresponding to the body parts of interest as well as study the lncRNA regulating mechanism for ESDs. ENCD also provides a flexible tool to visualize a disease- or gene-centric regulatory network. In addition, ENCD offers a submission page for researchers to submit their newly discovered endocrine disorders-genetic data entries online. Collectively, ENCD will provide comprehensive insights for investigating the ESDs associated with lncRNAs.

"36840614","eaQTLdb: An atlas of enhancer activity quantitative trait loci across cancer types. Enhancers are key regulatory elements that exert crucial roles in diverse biological processes, including tumorigenesis and cancer development. Active enhancers could produce transcripts termed enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which could be used as an index of enhancer activity. Here, we present a versatile data portal, enhancer activity quantitative trait loci database (eaQTLdb; http://www.bioailab.com:3838/eaQTLdb), for exploring the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity and prioritizing candidate variants across different cancer types. By leveraging the accumulated multiomics data, we systematically identified genetic variants which influence enhancer activity in different cancer types, termed as eaQTLs. We have linked the eaQTLs to hallmarks of cancer and patients' overall survival to illustrate their potential biological roles in cancer development and progression. Notably, eaQTLs associated with the infiltration abundance of 24 different immune cell types were identified and incorporated into eaQTLdb. In addition, we applied colocalization analyses to examine 59 complex diseases and traits to identify eaQTLs colocalized with diseases/traits GWAS signals. Overall, eaQTLdb, incorporating a rich resource for exploration of eaQTLs in different cancer types, will not only benefit users in prioritizing candidate genetic variants and enhancers, but also help researchers decipher the roles of eaQTLs in the dysregulated pathways of cancer and tumor immune microenvironment, opening new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues in precise medicine.","3/3/2023","http://www.bioailab.com:3838/eaQTLdb","eaQTLdb",0.997701942920685,"enhancer activity quantitative trait loci database",0.95836640894413,"eaQTLdb",0.997701943,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"34643729","scAPAatlas: an atlas of alternative polyadenylation across cell types in human and mouse. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) has been widely recognized as a crucial step during the post-transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that APA exerts key regulatory roles in many biological processes and often occurs in a tissue- and cell-type-specific manner. However, to our knowledge, there is no database incorporating information about APA at the cell-type level. Single-cell RNA-seq is a rapidly evolving and powerful tool that enable APA analysis at the cell-type level. Here, we present a comprehensive resource, scAPAatlas (http://www.bioailab.com:3838/scAPAatlas), for exploring APA across different cell types, and interpreting potential biological functions. Based on the curated scRNA-seq data from 24 human and 25 mouse normal tissues, we systematically identified cell-type-specific APA events for different cell types and examined the correlations between APA and gene expression level. We also estimated the crosstalk between cell-type-specific APA events and microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins. A user-friendly web interface has been constructed to support browsing, searching and visualizing multi-layer information of cell-type-specific APA events. Overall, scAPAatlas, incorporating a rich resource for exploration of APA at the cell-type level, will greatly help researchers chart cell type with APA and elucidate the biological functions of APA.","1/1/2022","http://www.bioailab.com:3838/scAPAatlas","scAPAatlas",0.992837250232696,"",0,"scAPAatlas",0.99283725,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"35617175","ADmeth: A Manually Curated Database for the Differential Methylation in Alzheimer's Disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. More and more evidence show that DNA methylation is closely related to the pathological mechanism of AD. Many AD-associated differentially methylated genes, regions and CpG sites have been identified in recent researches, which may have great potential in clinical research. However, there is no dedicated database to collect AD-related differential methylation up to now. To provide a reference to researchers, we design a database named ADmeth by manually curating relevant articles, which contains a total of 16,709 AD-related differentially methylated items identified from different brain regions and different cell types in the blood, involving 209 genes, 2,229 regions and 14,271 CpG sites. The ADmeth database provides user-friendly pages to search, submit and download data. We hope that the ADmeth database can facilitate researchers to select candidate AD-associated methylation markers in revealing the pathological mechanism of AD and promote the cell-free DNA based non-invasive diagnosis of AD.

"36305828","The new uORFdb: integrating literature, sequence, and variation data in a central hub for uORF research. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are initiated by AUG or near-cognate start codons and have been identified in the transcript leader sequences of the majority of eukaryotic transcripts. Functionally, uORFs are implicated in downstream translational regulation of the main protein coding sequence and may serve as a source of non-canonical peptides. Genetic defects in uORF sequences have been linked to the development of various diseases, including cancer. To simplify uORF-related research, the initial release of uORFdb in 2014 provided a comprehensive and manually curated collection of uORF-related literature. Here, we present an updated sequence-based version of uORFdb, accessible at https://www.bioinformatics.uni-muenster.de/tools/uorfdb. The new uORFdb enables users to directly access sequence information, graphical displays, and genetic variation data for over 2.4 million human uORFs. It also includes sequence data of >4.2 million uORFs in 12 additional species. Multiple uORFs can be displayed in transcript- and reading-frame-specific models to visualize the translational context. A variety of filters, sequence-related information, and links to external resources (UCSC Genome Browser, dbSNP, ClinVar) facilitate immediate in-depth analysis of individual uORFs. The database also contains uORF-related somatic variation data obtained from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses of 677 cancer samples collected by the TCGA consortium.","1/1/2023","http://www.bioinformatics.uni-muenster.de/tools/uorfdb","uORFdb",0.994009017944336,"",0,"uORFdb",0.994009018,1,"","24163100","","","","merge all ""dup name"" IDs","",NA,""

The bacterial family Mycobacteriaceae includes pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, and systematic research on their genome and phenome can give comprehensive perspectives for exploring their disease mechanism. In this study, the phenotypes of Mycobacteriaceae were inferred from available phenomic data, and 82 microbial phenotypic traits were recruited as data elements of the microbial phenome. This Mycobacteriaceae phenome contains five categories and 20 subcategories of polyphasic phenotypes, and three categories and eight subcategories of functional phenotypes, all of which are complementary to the existing data standards of microbial phenotypes. The phenomic data of Mycobacteriaceae strains were compiled by literature mining, third-party database integration, and bioinformatics annotation.

"36251776","BRACS: A Dataset for BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping in H&amp;E Histology Images. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and registers the highest number of deaths for women. Advances in diagnostic activities combined with large-scale screening policies have significantly lowered the mortality rates for breast cancer patients. However, the manual inspection of tissue slides by pathologists is cumbersome, time-consuming and is subject to significant inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently, the advent of whole-slide scanning systems has empowered the rapid digitization of pathology slides and enabled the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted digital workflows. However, AI techniques, especially Deep Learning, require a large amount of high-quality annotated data to learn from. Constructing such task-specific datasets poses several challenges, such as data-acquisition level constraints, time-consuming and expensive annotations and anonymization of patient information. In this paper, we introduce the BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) dataset, a large cohort of annotated Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E)-stained images to advance AI development in the automatic characterization of breast lesions. BRACS contains 547 Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) and 4539 Regions Of Interest (ROIs) extracted from the WSIs. Each WSI and respective ROIs are annotated by the consensus of three board-certified pathologists into different lesion categories. Specifically, BRACS includes three lesion types, i.e., benign, malignant and atypical, which are further subtyped into seven categories. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest annotated dataset for breast cancer subtyping both at WSI and ROI levels. Furthermore, by including the understudied atypical lesions, BRACS offers a unique opportunity for leveraging AI to better understand their characteristics. We encourage AI practitioners to develop and evaluate novel algorithms on the BRACS dataset to further breast cancer diagnosis and patient care.

"37162753","CaviDB: a database of cavities and their features in the structural and conformational space of proteins. Proteins are the structural, functional and evolutionary units of cells. On their surface, proteins are shaped into numerous depressions and protrusions that provide unique microenvironments for ligand binding and catalysis. The dynamics, size and chemical properties of these cavities are essential for a mechanistic understanding of protein function. Here, we present CaviDB, a novel database of cavities and their features in known protein structures. It integrates the results of commonly used cavity detection software with protein features derived from sequence, structural and functional analyses. Each protein in CaviDB is linked to its corresponding conformers, which also facilitates the study of conformational changes in cavities.

"36243964","isomiRdb: microRNA expression at isoform resolution. A significant fraction of mature miRNA transcripts carries sequence and/or length variations, termed isomiRs. IsomiRs are differentially abundant in cell types, tissues, body fluids or patients' samples. Not surprisingly, multiple studies describe a physiological and pathophysiological role. Despite their importance, systematically collected and annotated isomiR information available in databases remains limited. We thus developed isomiRdb, a comprehensive resource that compiles miRNA expression data at isomiR resolution from various sources. We processed 42 499 human miRNA-seq datasets (5.9 √É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬ó 1011 sequencing reads) and consistently analyzed them using miRMaster and sRNAbench. Our database provides online access to the 90 483 most abundant isomiRs (>1 RPM in at least 1% of the samples) from 52 tissues and 188 cell types. Additionally, the full set of over 3 million detected isomiRs is available for download. Our resource can be queried at the sample, miRNA or isomiR level so users can quickly answer common questions about the presence/absence of a particular miRNA/isomiR in tissues of interest. Further, the database facilitates to identify whether a potentially interesting new isoform has been detected before and its frequency. In addition to expression tables, isomiRdb can generate multiple interactive visualisations including violin plots and heatmaps. isomiRdb is free to use and publicly available at: https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb.","1/1/2023","http://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb","isomiRdb",0.99652338,"",0,"isomiRdb",0.9965233803,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""
"34850116","PLSDB: advancing a comprehensive database of bacterial plasmids. Plasmids are known to contain genes encoding for virulence factors and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Their relevance in metagenomic data processing is steadily growing. However, with the increasing popularity and scale of metagenomics experiments, the number of reported plasmids is rapidly growing as well, amassing a considerable number of false positives due to undetected misassembles. Here, our previously published database PLSDB provides a reliable resource for researchers to quickly compare their sequences against selected and annotated previous findings. Within two years, the size of this resource has more than doubled from the initial 13,789 to now 34,513 entries over the course of eight regular data updates. For this update, we aggregated community feedback for major changes to the database featuring new analysis functionality as well as performance, quality, and accessibility improvements. New filtering steps, annotations, and preprocessing of existing records improve the quality of the provided data. Additionally, new features implemented in the web-server ease user interaction and allow for a deeper understanding of custom uploaded sequences, by visualizing similarity information. Lastly, an application programming interface was implemented along with a python library, to allow remote database queries in automated workflows.

"34570238","miRNATissueAtlas2: an update to the human miRNA tissue atlas. Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) are pervasive regulators of physiological and pathological processes. We previously developed the human miRNA Tissue Atlas, detailing the expression of miRNAs across organs in the human body. Here, we present an updated resource containing sequencing data of 188 tissue samples comprising 21 organ types retrieved from six humans. Sampling the organs from the same bodies minimizes intra-individual variability and facilitates the making of a precise high-resolution body map of the non-coding transcriptome. The data allow shedding light on the organ- and organ system-specificity of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs. As use case of our resource, we describe the identification of highly specific ncRNAs in different organs.

"37871773","P450Rdb: a manually curated database of reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Introduction Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are recognized as the most versatile catalysts worldwide, playing vital roles in numerous biological metabolism and biosynthesis processes across all kingdoms of life. Despite the vast number of P450 genes available in databases (over 300,000), only a small fraction of them (less than 0.2%) have undergone functional characterization. Objectives To provide a convenient platform with abundant information on P450s and their corresponding reactions, we introduce the P450Rdb database, a manually curated resource compiles literature-supported reactions catalyzed by P450s. Methods All the P450s and Reactions were manually curated from the literature and known databases. Subsequently, the P450 reactions organized and categorized according to their chemical reaction type and site. The website was developed using HTML and PHP languages, with the MySQL server utilized for data storage. Results The current version of P450Rdb catalogs over 1,600 reactions, involving more than 590 P450s across a diverse range of over 200 species. Additionally, it offers a user-friendly interface with comprehensive information, enabling easy querying, browsing, and analysis of P450s and their corresponding reactions. P450Rdb is free available at http://www.cellknowledge.com.cn/p450rdb/. Conclusions We believe that this database will significantly promote structural and functional research on P450s, thereby fostering advancements in the fields of natural product synthesis, pharmaceutical engineering, biotechnological applications, agricultural and crop improvement, and the chemical industry.","10/21/2023","http://www.cellknowledge.com.cn/p450rdb","P450Rdb",0.988300308585167,"",0,"P450Rdb",0.988300309,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"36304304","ChanFAD: A Functional Annotation Database for Ion Channels. Ion channels are integral membrane protein complexes critical for regulation of membrane potential, cell volume, and other signaling events. As complex molecular assemblies with many interacting partners, ion channels have multiple structural and functional domains. While channel sequence and functional data are readily available across multiple online resources, there is an unmet need for functional annotation directly relating primary sequence information, 2D interactions, and three-dimensional protein structure. To this end, we present ChanFAD (Channel Functional Annotation Database), to provide the research community with a centralized resource for ion channel structure and functional data. ChanFAD provides functional annotation of PDB structures built on the National Center for Biotechnology Information's iCn3D structure viewing tool while providing additional information such as primary sequence, organism, and relevant links to other databases.

"36268860","The Chemical Probes Portal: an expert review-based public resource to empower chemical probe assessment, selection and use. We describe the Chemical Probes Portal (https://www.chemicalprobes.org/), an expert review-based public resource to empower chemical probe assessment, selection and use. Chemical probes are high-quality small-molecule reagents, often inhibitors, that are important for exploring protein function and biological mechanisms, and for validating targets for drug discovery. The publication, dissemination and use of chemical probes provide an important means to accelerate the functional annotation of proteins, the study of proteins in cell biology, physiology, and disease pathology, and to inform and enable subsequent pioneering drug discovery and development efforts. However, the widespread use of small-molecule compounds that are claimed as chemical probes but are lacking sufficient quality, especially being inadequately selective for the desired target or even broadly promiscuous in behaviour, has resulted in many erroneous conclusions in the biomedical literature. The Chemical Probes Portal was established as a public resource to aid the selection and best-practice use of chemical probes in basic and translational biomedical research. We describe the background, principles and content of the Portal and its technical development, as well as examples of its applications and use. The Chemical Probes Portal is a community resource and we therefore describe how researchers can be involved in its content and development.","1/1/2023","http://www.chemicalprobes.org","Probes",0.728829979896545,"Chemical Probes",0.517746418714523,"Probes",0.72882998,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","remove","","","FALSE POS: PARTIAL NAME",NA,""

"35070499","ChiroVox: a public library of bat calls. Recordings of bat echolocation and social calls are used for many research purposes from ecological studies to taxonomy. Effective use of these relies on identification of species from the recordings, but comparative recordings or detailed call descriptions to support identification are often lacking for areas with high biodiversity. The ChiroVox website (https://www.chirovox.org) was created to facilitate the sharing of bat sound recordings together with their metadata, including biodiversity data and recording circumstances. To date, more than 30 researchers have contributed over 3,900 recordings of nearly 200 species, making ChiroVox the largest open-access bat call library currently available. Each recording has a unique identifier that can be cited in publications; hence the acoustic analyses are repeatable. Most of the recordings available through the website are from bats whose species identities are confirmed, so they can be used to determine species in recordings where the bats were not captured or could not be identified. We hope that with the help of the bat researcher community, the website will grow rapidly and will serve as a solid source for bat acoustic research and monitoring.","1/13/2022","http://www.chirovox.org","ChiroVox",0.995782613754272,"",0,"ChiroVox",0.995782614,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Plant viruses were found to express larger number and higher levels of vsRNAs than those of animal viruses. Besides, the number of vsRNAs identified increased as the viral infection persisted. Interestingly, the vsRNA showed strong expression specificity as little overlap was observed among vsRNAs identified in different strains of a virus, or in different hosts, cells, or tissues infected by the same virus. Little conservation was observed among vsRNAs of different viruses. The viral miRNAs were found to interact with host genes involved in multiple biological processes related to organization, development, action potential, polarity establishment, methylation, immune response, gene regulation, localization, and so on. To facilitate the usage of vsRNAs, a database named vsRNAdb was built for organizing and storing vsRNAs which is available at http://www.computationalbiology.cn/vsRNAdb/#/vsRNAdb/#/.

"35552640","DFBP: a comprehensive database of food-derived bioactive peptides for peptidomics research. Motivation Food-derived bioactive peptides (FBPs) have demonstrated their significance in pharmaceuticals, diets and nutraceuticals, benefiting public health and global ecology. While significant efforts have been made to discover FBPs and to elucidate the underlying bioactivity mechanisms, there is lack of a systemic study of sequence-structure-activity relationship of FBPs in a large dataset. Results Here, we construct a database of food-derived bioactive peptides (DFBP), containing a total of 6276 peptide entries in 31 types from different sources. Further, we develop a series of analysis tools for function discovery/repurposing, traceability, multifunctional bioactive exploration and physiochemical property assessment of peptides. Finally, we apply this database and data-mining techniques to discover new FBPs as potential drugs for cardiovascular diseases. The DFBP serves as a useful platform for not only the fundamental understanding of sequence-structure-activity of FBPs but also the design, discovery, and repurposing of peptide-based drugs, vaccines, materials and food ingredients. Availability and implementation DFBP service can be accessed freely via http://www.cqudfbp.net/. All data are incorporated into the article and its online supplementary material.

"36548962","CyanoMapDB: a database integrating experimentally validated protein-protein interactions in cyanobacteria. As one of the essential life forms in the biosphere, research on cyanobacteria has been growing remarkably for decades. Biological functions in organisms are often accomplished through protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which help to regulate interacting proteins or organize them into an integral machine. However, the study of PPIs in cyanobacteria falls far behind that in mammals and has not been integrated for ease of use. Thus, we built CyanoMapDB (http://www.cyanomapdb.msbio.pro/), a database providing cyanobacterial PPIs with experimental evidence, consisting of 52,304 PPIs among 6,789 proteins from 23 cyanobacterial species. We collected available data in UniProt, STRING, and IntAct, and mined numerous PPIs from co-fractionation MS data in cyanobacteria. The integrated data are accessible in CyanoMapDB (http://www.cyanomapdb.msbio.pro/), enabling users to easily query proteins of interest, investigate interacting proteins with evidence from different sources, and acquire a visual network of the target protein.

"36419334, 33331653","DATAMAN: A global database of methane, nitrous oxide, and ammonia emission factors for livestock housing and outdoor storage of manure. Livestock manure management systems can be significant sources of nitrous oxide (N2 O), methane (CH4 ), and ammonia (NH3 ) emissions. Many studies have been conducted to improve our understanding of the emission processes and to identify influential variables in order to develop mitigation techniques adapted to each manure management step (animal housing, outdoor storage, and manure spreading to land). The international project DATAMAN (http://www.dataman.co.nz) aims to develop a global database on greenhouse gases (N2 O, CH4 ) and NH3 emissions from the manure management chain to refine emission factors (EFs) for national greenhouse gas and NH3 inventories. This paper describes the housing and outdoor storage components of this database. Relevant information for different animal categories, manure types, livestock buildings, outdoor storage, and climatic conditions was collated from published peer reviewed research, conference papers, and existing databases published between 1995 and 2021. In the housing database, 2024 EFs were collated (63% for NH3 , 19.5% for CH4 , and 17.5% for N2 O). The storage database contains 654 NH3 EFs from 16 countries, 243 CH4 EFs from 13 countries, and 421 N2 O EFs from 17 countries. Across all gases, dairy cattle and swine production in temperate climate zones are the most represented animal and climate categories. As for the housing database, the number of EFs for the tropical climate zone is under-represented. The DATAMAN database can be used for the refinement of national inventories and better assessment of the cost-effectiveness of a range of mitigation strategies.","12/7/2022","http://www.dataman.co.nz","DATAMAN",0.970632815,"",0,"DATAMAN",0.970632815,2,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

The Delphinieae Chromosome Database (DCDB) (last updated 31.12.2021) contains a total number of 3435 reports belonging to 425 species (503 taxa), which represents 48.6% of the total species of the tribe (an increase of c. 213% and 32% compared with the 1097 and 2598 reports gathered in the 1999 and 2016 versions, respectively). This increase is due both to chromosome research progress and to improved information capture system. Moreover, recent taxonomic advances, synonymization, and new phylogenetic criteria have also been considered.The DCDB database provides the most complete currently available information on published chromosome numbers, ploidy-level estimates, and other karyological data of Delphinieae, and it is aimed to be useful for the building of cytotaxonomical databases and for specific research ongoing projects of systematics and evolution of Ranunculaceae. DCDB includes two levels of taxonomic resolution, published name (original and standardized form) and database accepted name (based on either Plants of the World - POWO or expert specialist criteria), as well as the geographic origin of each count (country, locality, geographic coordinates, elevation, or ecological information when reported in the original publication), associated karyological data if originally provided (studied material type, graphic information, chromosome measures and formulas, satellites, B chromosomes, other cytogenetic techniques used, etc.), voucher information and reference (with DOI and other links to access the original document).

"34850130","TissueNexus: a database of human tissue functional gene networks built with a large compendium of curated RNA-seq data. Mapping gene interactions within tissues/cell types plays a crucial role in understanding the genetic basis of human physiology and disease. Tissue functional gene networks (FGNs) are essential models for mapping complex gene interactions. We present TissueNexus, a database of 49 human tissue/cell line FGNs constructed by integrating heterogeneous genomic data. We adopted an advanced machine learning approach for data integration because Bayesian classifiers, which is the main approach used for constructing existing tissue gene networks, cannot capture the interaction and nonlinearity of genomic features well. A total of 1,341 RNA-seq datasets containing 52,087 samples were integrated for all of these networks. Because the tissue label for RNA-seq data may be annotated with different names or be missing, we performed intensive hand-curation to improve quality. We further developed a user-friendly database for network search, visualization, and functional analysis. We illustrate the application of TissueNexus in prioritizing disease genes.

"35754095","DoPI: The Database of Pollinator Interactions. Despite the importance of pollinating insects to natural environments and agriculture, there have been few attempts to unite the existing plant-pollinator interaction datasets into a single depository using a common format. Accordingly, we have created one of the world's first online, open-access, and searchable pollinator-plant interaction databases. DoPI (The Database of Pollinator Interactions) was built from a systematic review of the scientific literature and unpublished datasets requested from researchers and organizations. We collated records of interactions between British plant and insect flower-visitor species (or genera), together with associated metadata (date, location, habitat, source publication) when available. The dataset currently (December 2021) contains 101,539 records, detailing over 320,000 interactions. The number of interactions (i.e., the number of times a pairwise species interaction was recorded per occasion) varies considerably among records, averaging 3.6. These include records from 1888 pollinator species and 1241 plant species, totaling >17,000 pairwise species interactions. By combining a large volume of information in a single repository, DoPI can be used to answer fundamental ecological questions on the dynamics of pollination interactions in space and time, as well as applied questions in conservation practice. We hope this dynamic database will be a useful tool not only for researchers, but also for conservationists, funding agencies, governmental departments, beekeepers, agronomists, and gardeners. We request that this paper is cited when using the data in publications and individual studies when appropriate. Researchers and organizations are encouraged to add further data in the future.

Each study's metadata are annotated using ontologies. The data are re-analyzed with the aim of reproducing the original conclusions of the underlying experiments. Expression Atlas is currently divided into Bulk Expression Atlas and Single Cell Expression Atlas. Expression Atlas contains data from differential studies (microarray and bulk RNA-Seq) and baseline studies (bulk RNA-Seq and proteomics), whereas Single Cell Expression Atlas is currently dedicated to Single Cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) studies.

In recent years, a huge amount of data on ncRNA interactions has been described in scientific papers and databases. Although considerable effort has been made to annotate the available knowledge in public repositories, there are still significant discrepancies in how different resources capture and interpret data on ncRNA functional and physical associations. In the present paper, we present a collection of microRNA-mRNA interactions annotated from the scientific literature following recognized standard criteria and focused on microRNAs, which regulate genes associated with rare diseases as a case study. The list of protein-coding genes with a known role in specific rare diseases was retrieved from the Genome England PanelApp, and associated microRNA-mRNA interactions were annotated in the IntAct database and compared with other datasets. RNAcentral identifiers were used for unambiguous, stable identification of ncRNAs. The information about the interaction was enhanced by a detailed description of the cell types and experimental conditions, providing a computer-interpretable summary of the published data, integrated with the huge amount of protein interactions already gathered in the database. Furthermore, for each interaction, the binding sites of the microRNA are precisely mapped on a well-defined mRNA transcript of the target gene. This information is crucial to conceive and design optimal microRNA mimics or inhibitors to interfere in vivo with a deregulated process. As these approaches become more feasible, high-quality, reliable networks of microRNA interactions are needed to help, for instance, in the selection of the best target to be inhibited and to predict potential secondary off-target effects.

Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) are widely observed in eukaryotes. Previous studies have demonstrated that eccDNAs are essential to cancer progression, and found that they can not only express in normal cells to regulate RNA, but also function differently in different tissues. It is of major interest to conduct computational or experiments assay to elucidate the mechanisms of eccDNA function, uncover key eccDNAs associated with diseases, and even develop related algorithms for liquid biopsy. Naturally, a comprehensive eccDNAs data resource is urgently needed to provide annotation and analysis more in-depth research. In this study, we constructed the eccBase (http://www.eccbase.net) in literature curation and database retrieval, which was the first database mainly collecting eccDNAs from Homo sapiens (n√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†=√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†754,391) and Mus musculus (n√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†=√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†481,381).

EccBase provided users with the ability to browse, search, download for targets of interest, as well as similarity alignment by the integrated BLAST. Further, comparative analysis suggested the cancer eccDNA is composed of nucleosomes and is prominently derived from the gene-dense regions. We also initially revealed that eccDNAs are strongly tissue-specific.

"35388171","eccDNAdb: a database of extrachromosomal circular DNA profiles in human cancers. Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) elements are circular DNA molecules that are derived from but are independent of chromosomal DNA. EccDNA is emerging as a rising star because of its ubiquitous existence in cancers and its crucial role in oncogene amplification and tumor progression. In the present study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of cancer samples were downloaded from public repositories. Afterwards, eccDNAs were identified from WGS data via bioinformatic analyses. To leverage database coverage, eccDNAs were also collected by manual curation of literatures. Gene expression and clinical data were downloaded from TCGA and CCLE and then used to investigate the roles of eccDNAs in cancers. Finally, the first integrated database of eccDNAs, eccDNAdb, was developed. eccDNAdb currently includes 1270 eccDNAs, which were identified in 480 samples (of 42 cancers) after analyzing a total number of 3395 tumor samples (of 57 cancers) including patient tissues, patient-derived xenografts, and cancer cell lines. A total number of 54,901 eccDNA genes were annotated and included in the database as well. With the integration of gene expression, clinical information and chromatin accessibility data, eccDNAdb enables users to easily determine the biological function and clinical relevance of eccDNAs in human cancers.

Here, we report the release of the greatest annual number of newly annotated genomes in the history of Ensembl via our dedicated Ensembl Rapid Release platform (http://rapid.ensembl.org). We have also developed a new method to generate comparative analyses at scale for these assemblies and, for the first time, we have annotated non-vertebrate eukaryotes. Meanwhile, we continually improve, extend and update the annotation for our high-value reference vertebrate genomes and report the details here. We have a range of specific software tools for specific tasks, such as the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and the newly developed interface for the Variant Recoder. All Ensembl data, software and tools are freely available for download and are accessible programmatically.","1/1/2022","http://www.ensembl.org, http://rapid.ensembl.org","Ensembl",0.992674469947815,"",0,"Ensembl",0.99267447,1,"36318249, 23203987, 24316576, 26888907, 26896847, 29155950, 30407521, 31691826, 26578574, 29092050, 31598706, 22086963","34634797, 36318249, 23203987, 24316576, 26888907, 26896847, 29155950, 30407521, 31691826, 26578574, 29092050, 31598706, 22086963","","","merge on record with best name prob","merge only:","",NA,"36318249, 23203987, 24316576, 26888907, 26896847, 29155950, 30407521, 31691826, 26578574, 29092050, 31598706, 22086963"

"35592546","The EWAS Catalog: a database of epigenome-wide association studies. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) seek to quantify associations between traits/exposures and DNA methylation measured at thousands or millions of CpG sites across the genome. In recent years, the increase in availability of DNA methylation measures in population-based cohorts and case-control studies has resulted in a dramatic expansion of the number of EWAS being performed and published. To make this rich source of results more accessible, we have manually curated a database of CpG-trait associations (with p<1x10 -4) from published EWAS, each assaying over 100,000 CpGs in at least 100 individuals. From January 7, 2022, The EWAS Catalog contained 1,737,746 associations from 2,686 EWAS. This includes 1,345,398 associations from 342 peer-reviewed publications. In addition, it also contains summary statistics for 392,348 associations from 427 EWAS, performed on data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The database is accompanied by a web-based tool and R package, giving researchers the opportunity to query EWAS associations quickly and easily, and gain insight into the molecular underpinnings of disease as well as the impact of traits and exposures on the DNA methylome.√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†The EWAS Catalog data extraction team continue to update the database monthly and we encourage any EWAS authors to upload their summary statistics to our website.

"37382165","Expansin gene family database: A comprehensive bioinformatics resource for plant expansin multigene family. Expansins, which are plant cell wall loosening proteins associated with cell growth, have been identified as a multigene family. Plant expansin proteins are an important family that functions in cell growth and many of developmental processes including wall relaxation, fruit softening, abscission, seed germination, mycorrhiza and root nodule formation, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, invasion of pollen tube stigma and organogenesis. In addition, it is thought that increasing the efficiency of plant expansin genes in plants plays a significant role, especially in the production of secondary bioethanol. When the studies on the expansin genes are examined, it is seen that the expansin genes are a significant gene family in the cell wall expansion mechanism. Therefore, understanding the efficacy of expansin genes is of great importance. Considering the importance of this multigene family, we aimed to create a comprehensively informed database of plant expansin proteins and their properties. The expansin gene family database provides comprehensive online data for the expansin gene family members in the plants. We have designed a new website accessible to the public, including expansin gene family members in 70 plants and their features including gene, coding and peptide sequences, chromosomal location, amino acid length, molecular weight, stability, conserved motif and domain structure and predicted three-dimensional architecture. Furthermore, a deep learning system was developed to detect unknown genes belonging to the expansin gene family. In addition, we provided the blast process within the website by establishing a connection to the NCBI BLAST site in the tools section. Thus, the expansin gene family database becomes a useful database for researchers that enables access to all datasets simultaneously with its user-friendly interface.

"35124170","The Human Eye Transcriptome Atlas: A searchable comparative transcriptome database for healthy and diseased human eye tissue. The applications of deep sequencing technologies in life science research and clinical diagnostics have increased rapidly over the last decade. Although fast algorithms for data processing exist, intuitive, portable solutions for data analysis are still rare. For this purpose, we developed a web-based transcriptome database, which provides a platform-independent, intuitive solution to easily explore and compare ocular gene expression of 100 diseased and healthy human tissue samples from 15 different tissue types collected at the Eye Center of the University of Freiburg. To ensure comparability of expression between different tissues, reads were normalized across all 100 samples. Differentially expressed genes were calculated between each tissue type to determine tissue-specific genes. Unsupervised analysis of all 100 samples revealed an accurate clustering according to different tissue types and a high tissue specificity by analyzing known tissue-specific marker genes. Bioinformatic cell type deconvolution using xCell provided detailed insights into the cellular profiles of each tissue type. Several new tissue-specific marker genes were identified. These genes were involved in tissue- or disease-specific processes, such as myelination for the optic nerve, visual perception for retina, keratinocyte differentiation for conjunctival carcinoma, as well as endothelial cell migration for choroidal neovascularization membranes. The results are accessible at the Human Eye Transcriptome Atlas website at https://www.eye-transcriptome.com. In summary, this searchable transcriptome database enables easy exploration of ocular gene expression in healthy and diseased human ocular tissues without bioinformatics expertise. Thus, it provides rapid access to detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms of various ocular tissues and diseases, as well as the rapid retrieval of potential new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.","2/3/2022","http://www.eye-transcriptome.com","",0,"Human Eye Transcriptome Atlas",0.717095291614532,"Human Eye Transcriptome Atlas",0.717095292,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

"37052519","EBD: an eye biomarker database. Motivation Many ophthalmic disease biomarkers have been identified through comprehensive multiomics profiling, and hold significant potential in advancing the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of diseases. Meanwhile, the eye itself serves as a natural biomarker for several systemic diseases including neurological, renal, and cardiovascular systems. We aimed to collect and standardize this eye biomarkers information and construct the eye biomarker database (EBD) to provide ophthalmologists with a platform to search, analyze, and download these eye biomarker data. Results In this study, we present the EBD <http://www.eyeseeworld.com/ebd/index.html>, a world-first online compilation comprising 889 biomarkers for 26 ocular diseases and 939 eye biomarkers for 181 systemic diseases. The EBD also includes the information of 78 ""nonbiomarkers""-the objects that have been proven cannot be biomarkers. Biological function and network analysis were conducted for these ocular disease biomarkers, and several hub pathways and common network topology characteristics were newly identified, which may promote future ocular disease biomarker discovery and characterizes the landscape of biomarkers for eye diseases at the pathway and network level. The EBD is expected to yield broader utility among developmental biologists and clinical scientists in and outside of the eye field by assisting in the identification of biomarkers linked to eye disorders and related systemic diseases.

Furthermore, a scaffold analysis showed that BraCoLi presents several privileged chemical skeletons with great diversity. Despite the similar distribution in the structural and physicochemical spaces, Tanimoto coefficient values indicated that compounds present in the BraCoLi are generally different from the two other databases, where they showed different kernel distributions and low similarity.

"37867975","PlantCHRs: A comprehensive database of plant chromatin remodeling factors. The Snf2 protein family is a group of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (CHRs) that play an essential role in gene expression regulation. In plants, Snf2 is involved in growth, development, as well as stress resistance. However, only a very limited number of experimentally validated Snf2 have been identified and reported, while the majority remaining undiscovered in most species . In this study, we predicted 3135 Snf2 proteins and 8398 chromatin remodeling complex (CRC) subunits in diverse plant species, and constructed the Plant Chromatin Remodeling Factors Database (PlantCHRs, http://www.functionalgenomics.cn/PlantCHRs/), which provide a comprehensive resource for researchers to access information about plant CHRs. We also developed an online tool capable of predicting CHRs and CRC subunits. Moreover, we investigated the distribution of Snf2 proteins in different species and observed a significant increase in the number of Snf2 proteins and the diversity of the Snf2 subfamily during the evolution, highlighting their evolutionary importance. By analyzing the expression patterns of the Snf2 genes in different tissues of maize and Arabidopsis, we found that the Snf2 proteins may show some conservation across different species in regulating plant growth and development. Over the all, we established a comprehensive database for plant CHRs, which will facilitate the researches on plant chromatin remodeling.","10/5/2023","http://www.functionalgenomics.cn/PlantCHRs","PlantCHRs",0.996765244007111,"Plant Chromatin Remodeling Factors Database",0.987776458263397,"PlantCHRs",0.996765244,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

The influence of adaptive evolution on disease susceptibility has drawn attention; however, the extent of the influence, whether favored mutations also influence drug responses, and whether the associations between the three are population-specific remain unknown. Using a reported deep learning network to integrate seven statistical tests for detecting selection signals, we predicted favored mutations in the genomes of 17 human populations and integrated these favored mutations with reported GWAS sites and drug response-related variants into the database PopTradeOff (http://www.gaemons.net/PopFMIntro). The database also contains genome annotation information on the SNP, sequence, gene, and pathway levels. The preliminary data analyses suggest that substantial associations exist between adaptive evolution, disease susceptibility, and drug responses and that the associations are highly population-specific.

"37867380","Investigation of pathogenic germline variants in gastric cancer and development of ""GasCanBase"" database. Background Gastric cancer, which is also known as stomach cancer, can be influenced by both germline and somatic mutations. Non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in germline have long been reported to play a pivotal role in cancer progression. Aim The aim of this study is to examine the nsSNP in GC-associated genes. The study also aims to develop a database with extensive information regarding the nsSNPs in the GC-associated genes and their impacts. Methods and results A total of 34,588 nsSNPs from 1,493,460 SNPs of the 40 genes were extracted from the available SNP database. Drug binding and energy minimization were examined by molecular docking and YASARA. To validate the existence of the germline CDH1 gene mutation (rs34466743) in the isolated blood DNA of gastric cancer (GC) patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing were performed. According to the results of the gene network analysis, 17 genes may interact with other types of cancer. A total of 11,363 nsSNPs were detected within the 40 GC genes. Among these, 474 nsSNPs were predicted to be damaging and 40 to be the most damaging. The SNPs in domain regions were thought to be strong candidates that alter protein functions. Our findings proposed that most of the selected nsSNPs were within the domains or motif regions.

Subsequently, drug binding confirmed the structural variation and the ineffectiveness of the drug against the mutant model in individuals with these germline variants. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of the rs34466743 germline variant from the CDH1 gene confirmed the strength and robustness of the pipeline that could expand the somatic alteration for causing cancer. In addition, a comprehensive gastric cancer polymorphism database named ""GasCanBase"" was developed to make data available to researchers. Conclusion The findings of this study and the ""GasCanBase"" database may greatly contribute to our understanding of molecular epidemiology and the development of precise therapeutics for gastric cancer.

"36454018","GeneFriends: gene co-expression databases and tools for humans and model organisms. Gene co-expression analysis has emerged as a powerful method to provide insights into gene function and regulation. The rapid growth of publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has created opportunities for researchers to employ this abundant data to help decipher the complexity and biology of genomes. Co-expression networks have proven effective for inferring the relationship between the genes, for gene prioritization and for assigning function to poorly annotated genes based on their co-expressed partners. To facilitate such analyses we created previously an online co-expression tool for humans and mice entitled GeneFriends. To continue providing a valuable tool to the scientific community, we have now updated the GeneFriends database and website. Here, we present the new version of GeneFriends, which includes gene and transcript co-expression networks based on RNA-seq data from 46 475 human and 34 322 mouse samples. The new database also encompasses tissue-specific gene co-expression networks for 20 human and 21 mouse tissues, dataset-specific gene co-expression maps based on TCGA and GTEx projects and gene co-expression networks for additional seven model organisms (fruit fly, zebrafish, worm, rat, yeast, cow and chicken).

Global activities involving the collection of marine biodiversity information have provided a large amount of biological observation records that cover various spatiotemporal areas. To predict biological responses or distribution changes in response to environmental changes by using these observation records, it is essential to analyze not only the current marine physicochemical environmental conditions but also the past conditions when the organisms were observed. We developed a new function to estimate the past marine environmental conditions for the observation records in our marine biodiversity database (Biological Information System for Marine Life: BISMaL) and examine whether the database can reliably estimate thermal habitats for both benthic and planktonic marine organisms. For the benthic squat lobster Shinkaia crosnieri, the estimated and observed in situ temperatures were similar to each other. For the planktonic chaetognaths Krohnitta pacifica and K. subtilis, the estimated temperatures showed clear seasonal changes specific to their distribution areas. These results indicated that BISMaL can reliably provide past habitat conditions regardless of planktonic or benthic lifestyles. BISMaL, which provides both biological observations and estimated past environmental conditions through web services, could lower the barrier to data access and use and make data-driven science available not only for data scientists but also for various marine scientists, such as taxonomists, ecologists and field scientists.

Gene knock-out/down methods are commonly used to explore the functions of genes of interest, but a database that systematically collects perturbed data is not available currently. Manual curation of all the available human cell line perturbed RNA-seq datasets enabled us to develop a comprehensive human perturbation database (GPSAdb, https://www.gpsadb.com/). The current version of GPSAdb collected 3048 RNA-seq datasets associated with 1458 genes, which were knocked out/down by siRNA, shRNA, CRISPR/Cas9, or CRISPRi. The database provides full exploration of these datasets and generated 6096 new perturbed gene sets (up and down separately). GPSAdb integrated the gene sets and developed an online tool, genetic perturbation similarity analysis (GPSA), to identify candidate causal perturbations from differential gene expression data.

"35789395","GGDB: A Grameneae genome alignment database of homologous genes hierarchically related to evolutionary events. The genomes of Gramineae plants have been preferentially sequenced owing to their economic value. These genomes are often quite complex, for example harboring many duplicated genes, and are the main source of genetic innovation and often the result of recurrent polyploidization. Deciphering these complex genome structures and linking duplicated genes to specific polyploidization events are important for understanding the biology and evolution of plants. However, efforts have been hampered by the complexity of analyzing these genomes. Here, we analyzed 29 well-assembled and up-to-date Gramineae genome sequences by hierarchically relating duplicated genes in collinear regions to specific polyploidization or speciation events. We separated duplicated genes produced by each event, established lists of paralogous and orthologous genes, and ultimately constructed an online database, GGDB (http://www.grassgenome.com/). Homologous gene lists from each plant and between plants can be displayed, searched, and downloaded from the database. Interactive comparison tools are deployed to demonstrate homology among user-selected plants and to draw genome-scale or local alignment figures and gene-based phylogenetic trees corrected by exploiting gene collinearity. Using these tools and figures, users can easily detect structural changes in genomes and explore the effects of paleo-polyploidy on crop genome structure and function. The GGDB will provide a useful platform for improving our understanding of genome changes and functional innovation in Gramineae plants.","8/1/2022","http://www.grassgenome.com","GGDB",0.993183851242065,"",0,"GGDB",0.993183851,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Esophageal carcinoma ranks as the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) being particularly prevalent among Asian populations. Alternative splicing (AS) plays a pivotal role in ESCC development and progression by generating diverse transcript isoforms. However, the current landscape lacks a specialized database focusing on alternative splicing events (ASEs) derived from a large number of ESCC cases. Additionally, most existing AS databases overlook the contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in ESCC molecular mechanisms, predominantly focusing on mRNA-based ASE identification. To address these limitations, we deployed DASES (http://www.hxdsjzx.cn/DASES). Employing a combination of publicly available and in-house ESCC RNA-seq datasets, our extensive analysis of 346 samples, with 93% being paired tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, led to the identification of 257 novel lncRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Leveraging a paired comparison of tumor and adjacent normal tissues, DASES identified 59,094 ASEs that may be associated with ESCC. DASES fills a critical gap by providing comprehensive insights into ASEs in ESCC, encompassing lncRNAs and mRNA, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of ESCC molecular mechanisms and serving as a valuable resource for ESCC research communities.","11/10/2023","http://www.hxdsjzx.cn/DASES","DASES",0.993409097194672,"",0,"DASES",0.993409097,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

In this study, iCAZyGFADB, which is a database website integrating nine gene function annotation tools, was perfectly developed to meet the needs of biological genome functional annotation. Its nine gene function annotation tools were Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZyme) annotation, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation, Cluster of Orthologous Gene (COG) annotation, Evolutionary Genealogy of Genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups (eggNOG) annotation, SwissProt annotation, Pfam annotation, KOG annotation and Animal Transcription Factor DataBase (AnimalTFDB) annotation. It has three advantages. First, it is superior to gene function annotation of other biological cloud analysis platforms and runs very fast. Second, all gene annotation functions of the website are free and open to users. Third, it can annotate eight gene functions (GO, KEGG, COG, eggNOG, SwissProt, Pfam, KOG and AnimalTFDB annotation) of a single species at the same time, while other cloud platforms do not have the ability or need to charge to open for users to complete the annotation of eight gene functions at the same time. Moreover, the development and operation of our database will provide great help for gene function annotation research and significantly improve the efficiency of genome function research and reduce the cost of bioinformatics analysis.

"35134877","PSL-LCCL: a resource for subcellular protein localization in liver cancer cell line SK_HEP1. The characterization of subcellular protein localization provides a basis for further understanding cellular behaviors. A delineation of subcellular localization of proteins on cytosolic membrane-bound organelles in human liver cancer cell lines (hLCCLs) has yet to be performed. To obtain its proteome-wide view, we isolated and enriched six cytosolic membrane-bound organelles in one of the hLCCLs (SK_HEP1) and quantified their proteins using mass spectrometry. The vigorous selection of marker proteins and a machine-learning-based algorithm were implemented to localize proteins at cluster and neighborhood levels. We validated the performance of the proposed method by comparing the predicted subcellular protein localization with publicly available resources. The profiles enabled investigating the correlation of protein domains with their subcellular localization and colocalization of protein complex members. A subcellular proteome database for SK_HEP1, including (i) the subcellular protein localization and (ii) the subcellular locations of protein complex members and their interactions, was constructed. Our research provides resources for further research on hLCCLs proteomics.

Here, we present DISCO (https://www.immunesinglecell.org/), a database of Deeply Integrated Single-Cell Omics data. The current release of DISCO integrates more than 18 million cells from 4593 samples, covering 107 tissues/cell lines/organoids, 158 diseases, and 20 platforms. We standardized the associated metadata with a controlled vocabulary and ontology system. To allow large scale integration of single-cell data, we developed FastIntegration, a fast and high-capacity version of Seurat Integration. We also developed CELLiD, an atlas guided automatic cell type identification tool. Employing these two tools on the assembled data, we constructed one global atlas and 27 sub-atlases for different tissues, diseases, and cell types. DISCO provides three online tools, namely Online FastIntegration, Online CELLiD, and CellMapper, for users to integrate, annotate, and project uploaded single-cell RNA-seq data onto a selected atlas.

"34871441","iProX in 2021: connecting proteomics data sharing with big data. The rapid development of proteomics studies has resulted in large volumes of experimental data. The emergence of big data platform provides the opportunity to handle these large amounts of data. The integrated proteome resource, iProX (https://www.iprox.cn), which was initiated in 2017, has been greatly improved with an up-to-date big data platform implemented in 2021. Here, we describe the main iProX developments since its first publication in Nucleic Acids Research in 2019. First, a hyper-converged architecture with high scalability supports the submission process. A hadoop cluster can store large amounts of proteomics datasets, and a distributed, RESTful-styled Elastic Search engine can query millions of records within one second. Also, several new features, including the Universal Spectrum Identifier (USI) mechanism proposed by ProteomeXchange,√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†RESTful Web Service API, and a high-efficiency reanalysis pipeline, have been added to iProX for better open data sharing. By the end of August 2021, 1526 datasets had been submitted to iProX, reaching a total data volume of 92.42TB. With the implementation of the big data platform, iProX can support PB-level data storage, hundreds of billions of spectra records, and second-level latency service capabilities that meet the requirements of the fast growing field of proteomics.","1/1/2022","http://www.iprox.cn","iProX",0.990910112857819,"",0,"iProX",0.990910113,1,"","30252093","","","","merge all ""dup name"" IDs","",NA,""

"36162726","ncFO: A Comprehensive Resource of Curated and Predicted ncRNAs Associated with Ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death driven by the accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides. Regulation of ferroptosis might be beneficial to cancer treatment. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a class of RNA transcripts that generally cannot encode proteins and have been demonstrated to play critical roles in regulating ferroptosis. Herein, we developed ncFO, the ncRNA-ferroptosis association database, to document the manually curated and predicted ncRNAs that are associated with ferroptosis. Collectively, ncFO contains 90 experimentally verified entries, including 46 microRNAs (miRNAs), 21 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 17 circular RNAs (circRNAs). In addition, ncFO also incorporates two online prediction tools based on the regulation and co-expression of ncRNA and ferroptosis genes. Using default parameters, we obtained 3260 predicted entries, including 598 miRNAs and 178 lncRNAs, by regulation, as well as 2,592,661 predicted entries, including 967 miRNAs and 9632 lncRNAs, by ncRNA-ferroptosis gene co-expression in more than 8000 samples across 20 cancer types. The detailed information of each entry includes ncRNA name, disease, species, tissue, target, regulation, publication time, and PubMed identifier. ncFO also provides survival analysis and differential expression analysis for ncRNAs. In summary, ncFO offers a user-friendly platform to search and predict ferroptosis-associated ncRNAs, which might facilitate research on ferroptosis and discover potential targets for cancer treatment. ncFO can be accessed at http://www.jianglab.cn/ncFO/.","9/23/2022","http://www.jianglab.cn/ncFO","ncFO",0.995647251605988,"",0,"ncFO",0.995647252,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

The KEGG database and analysis tools (https://www.kegg.jp) have been developed mostly for understanding genes and genomes of cellular organisms. The KO (KEGG Orthology) dataset, which is a collection of functional orthologs, plays the role of linking genes in the genome to pathways and other molecular networks, enabling KEGG mapping to uncover hidden features in the genome. Although viruses were part of KEGG for some time, they were not fully integrated in the KEGG analysis tools, because the KO assignment rate is very low for virus genes. To supplement KOs a new dataset named virus ortholog clusters (VOCs) is computationally generated, covering 90% of viral proteins in KEGG. VOCs can be used, in place of KOs, for taxonomy mapping to uncover relationships of sequence similarity groups and taxonomic groups and for identifying conserved gene orders in virus genomes. Furthermore, selected VOCs are used to define tentative KOs for characterizing protein functions. Here an overview of KEGG tools is presented focusing on these extensions for viral protein analysis.","12/1/2023","http://www.kegg.jp","KEGG",0.995484889,"Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes",0.887442343,"KEGG",0.995484889,3,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Background The domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris, is a companion animal for humans as well as an animal model in cancer research due to similar spontaneous occurrence of cancers as humans. Despite the social and biological importance of dogs, the catalogue of genomic variations and transcripts for dogs is relatively incomplete. Results We developed CanISO, a new database to hold a large collection of transcriptome profiles and genomic variations for domestic dogs. CanISO provides 87,692 novel transcript isoforms and 60,992 known isoforms from whole transcriptome sequencing of canine tumors (N√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â=√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â157) and their matched normal tissues (N√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â=√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬¢√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ä√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬â64).

"36323850","A database of 5305 healthy Korean individuals reveals genetic and clinical implications for an East Asian population. Despite substantial advances in disease genetics, studies to date have largely focused on individuals of European descent. This limits further discoveries of novel functional genetic variants in other ethnic groups. To alleviate the paucity of East Asian population genome resources, we established the Korean Variant Archive 2 (KOVA 2), which is composed of 1896 whole-genome sequences and 3409 whole-exome sequences from healthy individuals of Korean ethnicity. This is the largest genome database from the ethnic Korean population to date, surpassing the 1909 Korean individuals deposited in gnomAD. The variants in KOVA 2 displayed all the known genetic features of those from previous genome databases, and we compiled data from Korean-specific runs of homozygosity, positively selected intervals, and structural variants. In doing so, we found loci, such as the loci of ADH1A/1B and UHRF1BP1, that are strongly selected in the Korean population relative to other East Asian populations. Our analysis of allele ages revealed a correlation between variant functionality and evolutionary age. The data can be browsed and downloaded from a public website ( https://www.kobic.re.kr/kova/ ). We anticipate that KOVA 2 will serve as a valuable resource for genetic studies involving East Asian populations.","11/2/2022","http://www.kobic.re.kr/kova","KOVA 2",0.954003572463989,"Korean Variant Archive",0.791585445404053,"KOVA 2",0.954003572,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

CCLOOW reports frequency and contextual diversity metrics of the characters and words, as well as length and syntactic categories of the words. CCLOOW frequency and contextual diversity measures correlated well with other Chinese lexical databases, particularly well with that computed from children's books. The predictive validity of CCLOOW measures were confirmed with Grade 2 children's naming and lexical decision experiments. Further, we found that CCLOOW frequencies could explain a considerable proportion in adults' written word recognition, indicating that early language experience might have lasting impacts on the mature lexicon.

"35776384","CCLOWW: A grade-level Chinese children's lexicon of written words. In this article, we present the Chinese Children's Lexicon of Written Words (CCLOWW), the first grade-level database that provides frequency statistics of simplified Chinese characters and words for children. The database computes from a corpus of 34,671,424 character tokens and 22,427,010 word tokens (including single- and multicharacter words), extracted from 2131 books. It contains 6746 different character types and 153,079 different word types. CCLOWW provides several frequency indices of simplified Chinese for three grade levels (grade 2 and below, grades 3-4, grades 5-6) to profile children's experience with written Chinese in and outside of school. We describe in this article the distributions of frequency and contextual diversity of the characters and words, as well as word length and syntactic categories of the words in the corpus and the subcorpora. We also report results of correlation analyses with other written corpora and of several naming and lexicon decision experiments. The findings suggest that CCLOWW frequency measures correlate well with other corpora. Importantly, they could reliably predict children's and adults' naming and lexical decision performances.

"35964156","LettuceGDB: The community database for lettuce genetics and omics. As a globally popular leafy vegetable and a representative plant of the Asteraceae family, lettuce has great economic and academic significance. In the last decade, high-throughput sequencing, phenotyping, and other multi-omics data in lettuce have accumulated on a large scale, thus increasing the demand for an integrative lettuce database. Here, we report the establishment of a comprehensive lettuce database, LettuceGDB (https://www.lettucegdb.com/). As an omics data hub, the current LettuceGDB includes two reference genomes with detailed annotations; re-sequencing data from over 1000 lettuce varieties; a collection of more than 1300 worldwide germplasms and millions of accompanying phenotypic records obtained with manual and cutting-edge phenomics technologies; re-analyses of 256 RNA sequencing datasets; a complete miRNAome; extensive metabolite information for representative varieties and wild relatives; epigenetic data on the genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscape; and various lettuce research papers published in the last decade. Five hierarchically accessible functions (Genome, Genotype, Germplasm, Phenotype, and O-Omics) have been developed with a user-friendly interface to enable convenient data access. Eight built-in tools (Assembly Converter, Search Gene, BLAST, JBrowse, Primer Design, Gene Annotation, Tissue Expression, Literature, and Data) are available for data downloading and browsing, functional gene exploration, and experimental practice. A community forum is also available for information sharing, and a summary of current research progress on different aspects of lettuce is included. We believe that LettuceGDB can be a comprehensive functional database amenable to data mining and database-driven exploration, useful for both scientific research and lettuce breeding.","8/12/2022","http://www.lettucegdb.com","LettuceGDB",0.997271835803986,"",0,"LettuceGDB",0.997271836,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37131406","Landscape and significance of human super enhancer-driven core transcription regulatory circuitry. A core transcription regulatory circuitry (CRC) is an interconnected self-regulatory circuitry that is formed by a group of core transcription factors (TFs). These core TFs collectively regulate gene expression by binding not only to their own super enhancers (SEs) but also to the SEs of one another. For most human tissue/cell types, a global view of CRCs and core TFs has not been generated. Here, we identified numerous CRCs using two identification methods and detailed the landscape of the CRCs driven by SEs in large cell/tissue samples. The comprehensive biological analyses, including sequence conservation, CRC activity and genome binding affinity were conducted for common TFs, moderate TFs, and specific TFs, which exhibit different biological features. The local module located from the common CRC network highlighted the essential functions and prognostic performance. The tissue-specific CRC network was highly related to cell identity.

SEdb 2.0 (http://www.licpathway.net/sedb) aims to provide a comprehensive SE resource and annotate their potential roles in gene transcriptions. Compared with SEdb 1.0, we have made the following improvements: (i) Newly added the mouse SEs and expanded the scale of human SEs. SEdb 2.0 contained 1 167 518 SEs from 1739 human H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) samples and 550 226 SEs from 931 mouse H3K27ac ChIP-seq samples, which was five times that of SEdb 1.0. (ii) Newly added transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in SEs identified by TF motifs and TF ChIP-seq data. (iii) Added comprehensive (epi)genetic annotations of SEs, including chromatin accessibility regions, methylation sites, chromatin interaction regions and topologically associating domains (TADs). (iv) Newly embedded and updated search and analysis tools, including 'Search SE by TF-based', 'Differential-Overlapping-SE analysis' and 'SE-based TF-Gene analysis'. (v) Newly provided quality control (QC) metrics for ChIP-seq processing. In summary, SEdb 2.0 is a comprehensive update of SEdb 1.0, which curates more SEs and annotation information than SEdb 1.0.

LncPheDB sorted out a total of 203,391 lncRNA sequences, 2000 phenotypes, and 120,271 variants of nine species (Zea mays L., Gossypium barbadense L., Triticum aestivum L., Lycopersicon esculentum Mille, Oryza sativa L., Hordeum vulgare L., Sorghum bicolor L., Glycine max L., and Cucumis sativus L.). By exploring the relationship between lncRNAs and the genomic position of variants in genome-wide association analysis, a total of 68,862 lncRNAs were found to be related to the diversity of agronomic traits. More importantly, to facilitate the study of the functions of lncRNAs, we analyzed the possible target genes of lncRNAs, constructed a blast tool for performing similar fragmentation studies in all species, linked the pages of phenotypic studies related to lncRNAs that possess similar fragments and constructed their regulatory networks. In addition, LncPheDB also provides a user-friendly interface, a genome visualization platform, and multi-level and multi-modal convenient data search engine.

"38100461","AAAKB: A manually curated database for tracking and predicting genes of Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), an extremely dangerous vascular disease with high mortality, causes massive internal bleeding due to aneurysm rupture. To boost the research on AAA, efforts should be taken to organize and link the information about AAA-related genes and their functions. Currently, most researchers screen through genetic databases manually, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. Here, we developed ""AAAKB"" a manually curated knowledgebase containing genes, SNPs and pathways associated with AAA. In order to facilitate researchers to further explore the mechanism network of AAA, AAAKB provides predicted genes that are potentially associated with AAA. The prediction is based on the protein interaction information of genes collected in the database, and the random forest algorithm (RF) is used to build the prediction model. Some of these predicted genes are differentially expressed in patients with AAA, and some have been reported to play a role in other cardiovascular diseases, illustrating the utility of the knowledgebase in predicting novel genes. Also, AAAKB integrates a protein interaction visualization tool to quickly determine the shortest paths between target proteins. As the first knowledgebase to provide a comprehensive catalog of AAA-related genes, AAAKB will be an ideal research platform for AAA.

"35567946","PmiRtarbase: A positive miRNA-target regulations database. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22 nt small non-coding RNA segments that are widely involved in the regulation of gene expression. Accumulating evidences show that miRNAs not only inhibit the expression of some targeted genes but also promote that of some targeted genes in specific conditions. Over the past decades, many miRNA-target databases have been developed from computational prediction and/or experimental validation perspectives. However, there is no database available to systematically collect positive miRNA-target associations that are essential in deciphering the miRNA regulation mechanism. To promote the miRNA study, we developed a new database: PmiRtarbase that acquires validated positive miRNA-target interactions by mining published literature. It includes 312 curated associations between 119 miRNAs and 169 genes in 8 species from 130 studies and summarizes the conditions and detailed descriptions of the miRNA-target associations. We also constructed a database named PmiRtarbase, a user-friendly interface to conveniently search and download all related entries.

Here, we introduce the largest integration and proteogenomic analysis of novel peptides to assess the prevalence of non-canonical ORFs (ncORFs) in more than 900 patient proteomes and 26 immunopeptidome datasets across 14 cancer types. The integrative proteogenomic analysis of whole-cell proteomes and immunopeptidomes revealed peptide support for a nonredundant set of 9760 upstream, downstream, and out-of-frame ncORFs in protein coding genes and 12811 in noncoding RNAs. Notably, 6486 ncORFs were derived from differentially expressed genes and 340 were ubiquitously translated across eight or more cancers. The analysis also led to the discovery of thirty-four epitopes and eight neoantigens from non-canonical proteins in two cohorts as novel cancer immunotargets. Collectively, our analysis integrated both bottom-up proteogenomic and targeted peptide validation to illustrate the prevalence of translated non-canonical proteins in cancer and to provide a resource for the prioritization of novel proteins supported by proteomic, immunopeptidomic, genomic and transcriptomic data, available at https://www.maherlab.com/crypticproteindb.","6/1/2023","http://www.maherlab.com/crypticproteindb","CrypticProteinDB",0.622615993022919,"",0,"CrypticProteinDB",0.622615993,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

However, for fibrotic diseases, there is still a lack of an integrated platform with up-to-date information on RNA deregulation and high-throughput data. The Fibrotic Disease-associated RNAome database (FDRdb) (http://www.medsysbio.org/FDRdb) is a manually curated database of fibrotic disease-associated RNAome information and high-throughput datasets. This initial release (i) contains 1947 associations between 912 RNAs and 92 fibrotic diseases in eight species; (ii) collects information on 764 datasets of fibrotic diseases; (iii) provides a user-friendly web interface that allows users to browse, search and download the RNAome information on fibrotic diseases and high-throughput datasets and (iv) provides tools to analyze the expression profiles of fibrotic diseases, including differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment. The FDRdb is a valuable resource for researchers to explore the mechanisms of RNA dysregulation in organ fibrosis.

The virulence factor database (VFDB, http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/) is dedicated to presenting a comprehensive knowledge base and a versatile analysis platform for bacterial virulence factors (VFs). Recent developments in sequencing technologies have led to increasing demands to analyze potential VFs within microbiome data that always consist of many different bacteria. Nevertheless, the current classification of VFs from various pathogens is based on different schemes, which create a chaotic situation and form a barrier for the easy application of the VFDB dataset for future panbacterial metagenomic analyses. Therefore, based on extensive literature mining, we recently proposed a general category of bacterial VFs in the database and reorganized the VFDB dataset accordingly. Thus, all known bacterial VFs from 32 genera of common bacterial pathogens collected in the VFDB are well grouped into 14 basal categories along with over√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†100 subcategories in a hierarchical architecture.

"34634795","ZOVER: the database of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses. Emerging infectious diseases significantly threaten global public health and socioeconomic security. The majority of emerging infectious disease outbreaks are caused by zoonotic/vector-borne viruses. Bats and rodents are the two most important reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses that can cross species barriers to infect humans, whereas mosquitos and ticks are well-established major vectors of many arboviral diseases. Moreover, some emerging zoonotic diseases require a vector to spread or are intrinsically vector-borne and zoonotically transmitted. In this study, we present a newly upgraded database of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses designated ZOVER (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ZOVER). It incorporates two previously released databases, DBatVir and DRodVir, for bat- and rodent-associated viruses, respectively, and further collects up-to-date knowledge on mosquito- and tick-associated viruses to establish a comprehensive online resource for zoonotic and vector-borne viruses. Additionally, it integrates a set of online visualization tools for convenient comparative analyses to facilitate the discovery of potential patterns of virome diversity and ecological characteristics between/within different viral hosts/vectors. The ZOVER database will be a valuable resource for virologists, zoologists and epidemiologists to better understand the diversity and dynamics of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses and conduct effective surveillance to monitor potential interspecies spillover for efficient prevention and control of future emerging zoonotic diseases.","1/1/2022","http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ZOVER","ZOVER",0.996969223022461,"",0,"ZOVER",0.996969223,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Amaranth (Amaranthus L.) is native to Mexico and North America, where it was cultivated thousands of years ago, but now amaranth is grown worldwide. Amaranth is one of the most promising food crops with high nutritional value and belongs to the family Amaranthaceae. The high-quality genome assembly of cultivated amaranth species (A. hypochondriacus, A. cruentus) and wild/weedy species (A. tuberculatus, A. hybridus, and A. palmeri) has already been reported; therefore, we developed an Amaranth Genomic Resource Database (AGRDB) to provide access to all the genomic information such as genes, SSRs, SNPs, TFs, miRNAs, and transporters in one place. The AGRDB database contains functionally annotated gene information with their sequence details, genic as well as genomic SSRs with their three sets of primers, transcription factors classified into different families with their sequence information and annotation details, putative miRNAs with their family, sequences, and targeted gene details, transporter genes with their superfamily, trans-membrane domain details, and details of genic as well as nongenic SNPs with 3' and 5' flanking sequence information of five amaranth species. A database search can be performed using the gene ID, sequence ID, sequence motif, motif repeat, family name, annotation keyword, scaffold or chromosome numbers, etc. This resource also includes some useful tools, including JBrowse for the visualization of genes, SSRs, SNPs, and TFs on the respective amaranth genomes and BLAST search to perform a BLAST search of the user's query sequence against the amaranth genome as well as protein sequences. The AGRDB database will serve as a potential platform for genetic improvement and characterization of this futuristic crop.

"38142743","NCAD v1.0: a database for non-coding variant annotation and interpretation. The application of whole genome sequencing is expanding in clinical diagnostics across various genetic disorders, and the significance of non-coding variants in penetrant diseases is increasingly being demonstrated. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the diagnostic yield by exploring the pathogenic mechanisms of variants in non-coding regions. However, the interpretation of non-coding variants remains a significant challenge, due to the complex functional regulatory mechanisms of non-coding regions and the current limitations of available databases and tools. Hence, we develop the non-coding variant annotation database (NCAD, http://www.ncawdb.net/), encompassing comprehensive insights into 665,679,194 variants, regulatory elements, and element interaction details. Integrating data from 96 sources, spanning both GRCh37 and GRCh38 versions, NCAD v1.0 provides vital information to support the genetic diagnosis of non-coding variants, including allele frequencies of 12 diverse populations, with a particular focus on the population frequency information for 230,235,698 variants in 20,964 Chinese individuals. Moreover, it offers prediction scores for variant functionality, five categories of regulatory elements, and four types of non-coding RNAs.

NLM's conserved domain database (CDD) is a collection of protein domain and protein family models constructed as multiple sequence alignments. Its main purpose is to provide annotation for protein and translated nucleotide sequences with the location of domain footprints and associated functional sites, and to define protein domain architecture as a basis for assigning gene product names and putative/predicted function. CDD has been available publicly for over 20 years and has grown substantially during that time. Maintaining an archive of pre-computed annotation continues to be a challenge and has slowed down the cadence of CDD releases. CDD curation staff builds hierarchical classifications of large protein domain families, adds models for novel domain families via surveillance of the protein 'dark matter' that currently lacks annotation, and now spends considerable effort on providing names and attribution for conserved domain architectures.

This influences the comprehension of their functions and future research on these cotton species. Here, we report high confidence lncRNAs and miRNA collection from G. hirsutum accession and G. barbadense accession using large-scale RNA-seq and small RNA-seq datasets incorporated into a user-friendly database, CoNCRAtlas. This database provides a wide range and depth of lncRNA and miRNA annotation based on the systematic integration of extensive annotations such as expression patterns derived from transcriptome data analysis in thousands of samples, as well as multi-omics annotations.

"37824297","Stress combinations and their interactions in plants database: a one-stop resource on combined stress responses in plants. We have developed a compendium and interactive platform, named Stress Combinations and their Interactions in Plants Database (SCIPDb; http://www.nipgr.ac.in/scipdb.php), which offers information on morpho-physio-biochemical (phenome) and molecular (transcriptome and metabolome) responses of plants to different stress combinations. SCIPDb is a plant stress informatics hub for data mining on phenome, transcriptome, trait-gene ontology, and data-driven research for advancing mechanistic understanding of combined stress biology. We analyzed global phenome data from 939 studies to delineate the effects of various stress combinations on yield in major crops and found that yield was substantially affected under abiotic-abiotic stresses. Transcriptome datasets from 36 studies hosted in SCIPDb identified novel genes, whose roles have not been earlier established in combined stress. Integretome analysis under combined drought-heat stress pinpointed carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism pathways as the crucial metabolic, proteomic, and transcriptional components in plant tolerance to combined stress. These examples illustrate the application of SCIPDb in identifying novel genes and pathways involved in combined stress tolerance. Further, we showed the application of this database in identifying novel candidate genes and pathways for combined drought and pathogen stress tolerance. To our knowledge, SCIPDb is the only publicly available platform offering combined stress-specific omics big data visualization tools, such as an interactive scrollbar, stress matrix, radial tree, global distribution map, meta-phenome analysis, search, BLAST, transcript expression pattern table, Manhattan plot, and co-expression network. These tools facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant responses to combined stresses.","10/12/2023","http://www.nipgr.ac.in/scipdb.php","SCIPDb",0.998294740915298,"Stress Combinations and their Interactions in Plants Database",0.98637678027153,"SCIPDb",0.998294741,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"34718710","The Natural Products Atlas 2.0: a database of microbially-derived natural products. Within the natural products field there is an increasing emphasis on the study of compounds from microbial sources. This has been fuelled by interest in the central role that microorganisms play in mediating both interspecies interactions and host-microbe relationships. To support the study of natural products chemistry produced by microorganisms we released the Natural Products Atlas, a database of known microbial natural products structures, in 2019. This paper reports the release of a new version of the database which includes a full RESTful application programming interface (API), a new website framework, and an expanded database that includes 8128 new compounds, bringing the total to 32 552. In addition to these structural and content changes we have added full taxonomic descriptions for all microbial taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from both NP Classifier and ClassyFire. We have also performed manual curation to review all entries with incomplete configurational assignments and have integrated data from external resources, including CyanoMetDB. Finally, we have improved the user experience by updating the Overview dashboard and creating a dashboard for taxonomic origin.

"35150127","GNIFdb: a neoantigen intrinsic feature database for glioma. Abstract Neoantigens are mutation-containing immunogenic peptides from tumor cells. Neoantigen intrinsic features are neoantigens' sequence-associated features characterized by different amino acid descriptors and physical-chemical properties, which have a crucial function in prioritization of neoantigens with immunogenic potentials and predicting patients with better survival. Different intrinsic features might have functions to varying degrees in evaluating neoantigens' potentials of immunogenicity. Identification and comparison of intrinsic features among neoantigens are particularly important for developing neoantigen-based personalized immunotherapy. However, there is still no public repository to host the intrinsic features of neoantigens. Therefore, we developed GNIFdb, a glioma neoantigen intrinsic feature database specifically designed for hosting, exploring and visualizing neoantigen and intrinsic features.

Organs-on-a-chip is a microfluidic microphysiological system that uses microfluidic technology to analyze the structure and function of living human cells at the tissue and organ levels in vitro. Organs-on-a-chip technology, as opposed to traditional two-dimensional cell culture and animal models, can more closely simulate pathologic and toxicologic interactions between different organs or tissues and reflect the collaborative response of multiple organs to drugs. Despite the fact that many organs-on-a-chip-related data have been published, none of the current databases have all of the following functions: searching, downloading, as well as analyzing data and results from the literature on organs-on-a-chip. Therefore, we created an organs-on-a-chip database (OOCDB) as a platform to integrate information about organs-on-a-chip from various sources, including literature, patents, raw data from microarray and transcriptome sequencing, several open-access datasets of organs-on-a-chip and organoids, and data generated in our laboratory. OOCDB contains dozens of sub-databases and analysis tools, and each sub-database contains various data associated with organs-on-a-chip, with the goal of providing researchers with a comprehensive, systematic, and convenient search engine.

"37639797","HMDB: A curated database of genes involved in hydrocarbon monooxygenation reaction with homologous genes as background. The investigation of hydrocarbon degradation potential of environmental microorganisms is an important research topic, whether for the global carbon cycle or oil pollution remediation. Under aerobic conditions, the microorganisms employ a range of monooxygenases to use hydrocarbons substrates as a source of carbon and energy. With the explosion of sequencing data, mining genes in genomes or metagenomes has become computationally expensive and time-consuming. We proposed the HMDB, which is a professional gene database of hydrocarbon monooxygenases. HMDB contains 38 genes, which encode 11 monooxygenases responsible for the hydroxylation of 8 hydrocarbons. To reduce false positives, the strategy of using homologous genes as background noise was applied for HMDB. We added 10,095 gene sequences of homologous enzymes which took non-hydrocarbons as substrates to HMDB. The classic BLAST method and best-hit strategy were recommended for HMDB usage, but not limited. The performance of HMDB was validated using 264,402 prokaryote genomes from RefSeq and 51 metagenomes from SRA. The results showed that HMDB database had high sensitivity and low false positive rate. We release the HMDB database here, hoping to speed up the process for investigation of hydrocarbon monooxygenases in massive metagenomic data.

"35690280","exRNAdisease: An extracellular RNA transcriptome atlas in human diseases. Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are types of RNAs that present outside of the cells with highly stable features. exRNAs have been shown to play important roles in aiding intercellular communication and regulating cellular processes. In clinical settings, exRNAs have the potential to serve as biomarkers indicating the presence of a disease.Recently, the high-throughput technologies such as RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and microarray have generated abundant exRNA expression data about various diseases. Thus, it is highly desirable to have a comprehensive database for disease-related exRNA transcriptome data detected in diverse body fluids. Here, a total of 88 previously published exRNA transcriptome datasets were collected. We developed a web-accessible database, exRNADisease, which is designed as a central repository for exRNAs from body fluids in human diseases and healthy controls. In the current version, a total of 18,265 samples were collected, which includes 10 body fluids and 78 human disease types. Six different types of RNAs were included (messenger RNAs, circular RNAs, long noncoding RNAs, microRNAs, transfer RNA fragments and PIWI-interacting RNA). Literature is also included to provide the robust evidence about the relationship between exRNAs and diseases. A user-friendly interface was constructed to conveniently search and browse disease-related exRNAs. exRNADisease will become a useful platform to provide genome-wide view of exRNA deregulation in human diseases and help to identify novel biomarkers.

"34581813","CovPDB: a high-resolution coverage of the covalent protein-ligand interactome. In recent years, the drug discovery paradigm has shifted toward compounds that covalently modify disease-associated target proteins, because they tend to possess high potency, selectivity, and duration of action. The rational design of novel targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) typically starts from resolved macromolecular structures of target proteins in their apo or holo forms. However, the existing TCI databases contain only a paucity of covalent protein-ligand (cP-L) complexes. Herein, we report CovPDB, the first database solely dedicated to high-resolution cocrystal structures of biologically relevant cP-L complexes, curated from the Protein Data Bank. For these curated complexes, the chemical structures and warheads of pre-reactive electrophilic ligands as well as the covalent bonding mechanisms to their target proteins were expertly manually annotated. Totally, CovPDB contains 733 proteins and 1,501 ligands, relating to 2,294 cP-L complexes, 93 reactive warheads, 14 targetable residues, and 21 covalent mechanisms. Users are provided with an intuitive and interactive web interface that allows multiple search and browsing options to explore the covalent interactome at a molecular level in order to develop novel TCIs. CovPDB is freely accessible at http://www.pharmbioinf.uni-freiburg.de/covpdb/ and its contents are available for download as flat files of various formats.","1/1/2022","http://www.pharmbioinf.uni-freiburg.de/covpdb","CovPDB",0.997268796,"",0,"CovPDB",0.997268796,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"34718760","PhylomeDB V5: an expanding repository for genome-wide catalogues of annotated gene phylogenies. PhylomeDB is a unique knowledge base providing public access to minable and browsable catalogues of pre-computed genome-wide collections of annotated sequences, alignments and phylogenies (i.e. phylomes) of homologous genes, as well as to their corresponding phylogeny-based orthology and paralogy relationships. In addition, PhylomeDB trees and alignments can be downloaded for further processing to detect and date gene duplication events, infer past events of inter-species hybridization and horizontal gene transfer, as well as to uncover footprints of selection, introgression, gene conversion, or other relevant evolutionary processes in the genes and organisms of interest. Here, we describe the latest evolution of PhylomeDB (version 5). This new version includes a newly implemented web interface and several new functionalities such as optimized searching procedures, the possibility to create user-defined phylome collections, and a fully redesigned data structure. This release also represents a significant core data expansion, with the database providing access to 534 phylomes, comprising over 8 million trees, and homology relationships for genes in over 6000 species.

"35508965","A database for retrieving information on SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations based on correlation network analysis. Background Over a million genomes and mutational analyses of SARS-CoV-2 are available in public databases, which reveal the phylogenetic tree of the virus. Although these data have enabled scientists to closely track the evolution and transmission dynamics of the virus at global and local scales, the Mu variant, recently identified in infections in South America, shows an unusual combination of mutations, and it is difficult to visualize these atypical characteristics in public databases based on a phylogenetic tree. Results The Vcorn SARS-CoV-2 database was constructed to provide information on COVID-19 infections and mutations in the S protein of the virus based on correlation network analysis. A correlation network was constructed using the recall index of one mutation to another mutation. The network includes several network modules in which nodes represent mutations and are tightly connected to each other. Individual network modules contain mutations of single variants, such as the alpha and delta variants. In the network constructed to emphasize mutations of the Mu variant using the database, the mutations were found to be located in multiple network modules, indicating that the mutations of the variant may have originated from multiple variants or be located at a basal position with a high frequency of mutation. Conclusions Vcorn SARS-CoV-2 provides information on COVID-19 and S protein mutations of SARS-CoV-2 via correlation network analysis. The network based on the analysis illustrates the unusual S protein mutations of the Mu variant.

"35000252","Plant cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins: an update on classification, nomenclature, evolution and resources. Standardized naming systems are essential to integrate and unify distinct research fields, and to link multi-species data within and across kingdoms. We conducted a comprehensive survey of cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (CRPs) in the dicot model Arabidopsis thaliana and the monocot model rice, noting that the standardized naming system has not been widely adopted in the plant community. We generated a database linking the old classical names to their updated and compliant names. We also explored the sequences, molecular evolution, and structural and functional characteristics of all plant CRP families, emphasizing evolutionarily conserved and plant-specific features through cross-kingdom comparisons. Unlike fungal CRP paralogs that were mainly created by whole-genome duplication (WGD) or retroposition under a concerted evolution mode, plant CRP genes evolved primarily through both WGD and tandem duplications in a rapid birth-and-death process.

"35438150","PltDB: a blood platelets-based gene expression database for disease investigation. Motivation Molecular profiling of blood-based liquid biopsies is a promising disease detection method, which overcomes the limitations of invasive diagnostic strategies. Recently, gene expression profiling of platelets reportedly provides valuable resource for developing new biomarkers for the detection of diseases, including cancer. However, there is no database containing RNAs in platelets. Results In this study, we constructed PltDB (http://www.pltdb-hust.com), a blood platelets-based gene expression database featuring integration and visualization of RNA expression profiles based on RNA-seq and microarray data spanning both normal individuals and patients with different diseases. PltDB currently contains the expression landscape of mRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs and miRNAs in platelets from patients with different disease types and healthy controls. Moreover, PltDB provides users with the tools for visualizing results of comparison and correlation analysis and for downloading expression profiles and analysis results. A submission interface for the scientific community is also embraced for uploading novel RNA expression profiles derived from platelet samples. PltDB will offer a comprehensive review of the clinical use of platelets, overcome technical problems when analyzing data from diverse studies and serve as a powerful platform for developing new blood biomarkers.

"35933489","Quorum sensing-based interactions among drugs, microbes, and diseases. Many diseases and health conditions are closely related to various microbes, which participate in complex interactions with diverse drugs; nonetheless, the detailed targets of such drugs remain to be elucidated. Many existing studies have reported causal associations among drugs, gut microbes, or diseases, calling for a workflow to reveal their intricate interactions. In this study, we developed a systematic workflow comprising three modules to construct a Quorum Sensing-based Drug-Microbe-Disease (QS-DMD) database ( http://www.qsdmd.lbci.net/ ), which includes diverse interactions for more than 8,000 drugs, 163 microbes, and 42 common diseases. Potential interactions between microbes and more than 8,000 drugs have been systematically studied by targeting microbial QS receptors combined with a docking-based virtual screening technique and in vitro experimental validations. Furthermore, we have constructed a QS-based drug-receptor interaction network, proposed a systematic framework including various drug-receptor-microbe-disease connections, and mapped a paradigmatic circular interaction network based on the QS-DMD, which can provide the underlying QS-based mechanisms for the reported causal associations. The QS-DMD will promote an understanding of personalized medicine and the development of potential therapies for diverse diseases. This work contributes to a paradigm for the construction of a molecule-receptor-microbe-disease interaction network for human health that may form one of the key knowledge maps of precision medicine in the future.","8/4/2022","http://www.qsdmd.lbci.net","QS-DMD",0.988350605964661,"Sensing",0.726606905460358,"QS-DMD",0.988350606,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

The resulting database will support analyses to estimate significant clinical events and provide directions for targeting interventions and assessing their impacts. Method: The Nigerian study sited at Centre of Excellence for Sickle Cell Disease Research and Training (CESRTA), University of Abuja, adopted REDCap for online database management. The case report form (CRF) was adapted from 1,400 data elements adopted by SPARCO sites. It captures 215 data elements of interest across sub-sites, i.e., demographic, social, diagnostic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and others. These were harmonized using the SADaCC data dictionary. REDCap was installed on University of Abuja cloud server at https://www.redcap.uniabuja.edu.ng. Data collected at the sites are sent to CESRTA for collation, cleaning and uploading to the database. Results: 7,767 people living with sickle cell disease were enrolled at 25 health institutions across the six zones in Nigeria with 5,295 having had at least one follow-up visit with their clinical data updated. They range from 44 to 1,180 from 3 centers from South East, 4 from South, 5 from South West, 8 from North Central, 4 in North West and 3 in the North East. North West has registered 1,383 patients, representing 17.8%; North East, 359 (4.6%); North Central, 2,947 (37.9%); South West, 1,609 (20.7%); South, 442 (5.7%) and South East, 1,027 patients (13.2%). Conclusion: The database is being used to support studies including analysis of clinical phenotypes of SCD in Nigeria, and evaluation of Hydroxyurea use in SCD. Reports undergoing review in journals have relied on the ease of data access in REDCap.

"37386732","REDH: A database of RNA editome in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancy. Background The conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) through deamination is the prevailing form of RNA editing, impacting numerous nuclear and cytoplasmic transcripts across various eukaryotic species. Millions of high-confidence RNA editing sites have been identified and integrated into various RNA databases, providing a convenient platform for the rapid identification of key drivers of cancer and potential therapeutic targets. However, the available database for integration of RNA editing in hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic malignancies is still lacking. Methods We downloaded RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 29 leukemia patients and 19 healthy donors from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and RNA-seq data of 12 mouse hematopoietic cell populations obtained from our previous research were also used. We performed sequence alignment, identified RNA editing sites, and obtained characteristic editing sites related to normal hematopoietic development and abnormal editing sites associated with hematologic diseases. Results We established a new database, ""REDH"", represents RNA editome in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancy. REDH is a curated database of associations between RNA editome and hematopoiesis. REDH integrates 30,796 editing sites from 12 murine adult hematopoietic cell populations and systematically characterizes more than 400,000 edited events in malignant hematopoietic samples from 48 cohorts (human). Through the Differentiation, Disease, Enrichment, and knowledge modules, each A-to-I editing site is systematically integrated, including its distribution throughout the genome, its clinical information (human sample), and functional editing sites under physiological and pathological conditions. Furthermore, REDH compares the similarities and differences of editing sites between different hematologic malignancies and healthy control. Conclusions REDH is accessible at http://www.redhdatabase.com/ . This user-friendly database would aid in understanding the mechanisms of RNA editing in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancies. It provides a set of data related to the maintenance of hematopoietic homeostasis and identifying potential therapeutic targets in malignancies.","6/30/2023","http://www.redhdatabase.com","REDH",0.978171423077583,"",0,"REDH",0.978171423,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

Numerous studies have shown that RNA plays an important role in the occurrence and development of diseases, and RNA-disease associations are not limited to noncoding RNAs in mammals but also exist for protein-coding RNAs. Furthermore, RNA-associated diseases are found across species including plants and nonmammals. To better analyze diseases at the RNA level and facilitate researchers in exploring the pathogenic mechanism of diseases, we decided to update and change MNDR v3.0 to RNADisease v4.0, a repository for RNA-disease association (http://www.rnadisease.org/ or http://www.rna-society.org/mndr/). Compared to the previous version, new features include: (i) expanded data sources and categories of species, RNA types, and diseases; (ii) the addition of a comprehensive analysis of RNAs from thousands of high-throughput sequencing data of cancer samples and normal samples; (iii) the addition of an RNA-disease enrichment tool√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬Ç√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬†and (iv) the addition of four RNA-disease prediction tools.

"34718740","RNAPhaSep: a resource of RNAs undergoing phase separation. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) partitions cellular contents, underlies the formation of membraneless organelles and plays essential biological roles. To date, most of the research on LLPS has focused on proteins, especially RNA-binding proteins. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that RNAs can also function as 'scaffolds' and play essential roles in seeding or nucleating the formation of granules. To better utilize the knowledge dispersed in published literature, we here introduce RNAPhaSep (http://www.rnaphasep.cn), a manually curated database of RNAs undergoing LLPS. It contains 1113 entries with experimentally validated RNA self-assembly or RNA and protein co-involved phase separation events. RNAPhaSep contains various types of information, including RNA information, protein information, phase separation experiment information and integrated annotation from multiple databases. RNAPhaSep provides a valuable resource for exploring the relationship between RNA properties and phase behaviour, and may further enhance our comprehensive understanding of LLPS in cellular functions and human diseases.","1/1/2022","http://www.rnaphasep.cn","RNAPhaSep",0.996838629245758,"",0,"RNAPhaSep",0.996838629,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"35133406","GRNDaD: big data and sickle cell disease. Big data are used in the pursuit of precision medicine in the general population. Applying these tools to patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is essential for ensuring that they receive the most appropriate customized therapy for their disease. For these tools to be applied, there must be a large number of willing, fully phenotyped participants in collaborative registries. Working collaboratively to respond to unmet clinical needs and the lack of a large multisite registry, SCD providers at multiple sites developed The Globin Regional Data and Discovery (GRNDaD) registry. The specific goals of GRNDaD are to (1) prospectively obtain high-quality curated data on the evolving population affected by SCD; (2) improve adherence to guideline-based care; (3) provide a platform for ongoing quality improvement across sites; (4) allow for real-time investigation of therapies, and collaborate broadly to address research questions using GRNDaD as a shared platform. GRNDaD's current strength lies in the generous participation of people living with SCD, collaborative investigators, and the opportunity to conduct quality improvement activities across a large number of sites. GRNDaD will serve as the data collection tool for the Health Resources and Services Administration Sickle Cell Treatment Demonstration Program and for the newly established National Alliance for Sickle Cell Centers (https://www.sicklecellcenters.org/).

"34302483","piRNAclusterDB 2.0: update and expansion of the piRNA cluster database. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and their partnering PIWI proteins defend the animal germline against transposable elements and play a crucial role in fertility. Numerous studies in the past have uncovered many additional functions of the piRNA pathway, including gene regulation, anti-viral defense, and somatic transposon repression. Further, comparative analyses across phylogenetic groups showed that the PIWI/piRNA system evolves rapidly and exhibits great evolutionary plasticity. However, the presence of so-called piRNA clusters as the major source of piRNAs is common to nearly all metazoan species. These genomic piRNA-producing loci are highly divergent across taxa and critically influence piRNA populations in different evolutionary lineages. We launched the initial version of the piRNA cluster database to facilitate research on regulation and evolution of piRNA-producing loci across tissues und species. In recent years the amount of small RNA sequencing data that was generated and the abundance of species that were studied has grown rapidly. To keep up with this recent progress, we have released a major update for the piRNA cluster database (https://www.smallrnagroup.uni-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB), expanding it from 12 to a total of 51 species with hundreds of new datasets, and revised its overall structure to enable easy navigation through this large amount of data.","1/1/2022","http://www.smallrnagroup.uni-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB","piRNAclusterDB",0.652865052223206,"",0,"piRNAclusterDB",0.652865052,1,"","","low_prob_best_name","do not remove","","","",NA,""

Background As a key process in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, alternative splicing (AS) plays a crucial role in maintaining the diversity of RNA and protein expression, and mediates the immune response in infectious diseases, especially for the COVID-19. Therefore, urgent data gathering and more research of AS profiles in microbe-infected human cells are needed to improve understanding of COVID-19 and related infectious diseases. Herein, we have created CASA, the COVID-19 Alternative Splicing Atlas to provide a convenient computing platform for studies of AS in COVID-19 and COVID-19-related infectious diseases. Methods In CASA, we reanalyzed thousands of RNA-seq datasets generated from 65 different tissues, organoids and cell lines to systematically obtain quantitative data on AS events under different conditions. A total of 262,994 AS events from various infectious diseases with differing severity were detected and visualized in this database. In order to explore the potential function of dynamics AS events, we performed analysis of functional annotations and drug-target interactions affected by AS in each dataset. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which may regulate these dynamic AS events are also provided for users in this database. Results CASA displays microbe-induced alterations of the host cell splicing landscape across different virus families and helps users identify condition-specific splicing patterns, as well as their potential regulators.

"34927675, 34927675","CRPMKB: a knowledge base of cancer risk prediction models for systematic comparison and personalized applications. Motivation In the era of big data and precision medicine, accurate risk assessment is a prerequisite for the implementation of risk screening and preventive treatment. A large number of studies have focused on the risk of cancer, and related risk prediction models have been constructed, but there is a lack of effective resource integration for systematic comparison and personalized applications. Therefore, the establishment and analysis of the cancer risk prediction model knowledge base (CRPMKB) is of great significance. Results The current knowledge base contains 802 model data. The model comparison indicates that the accuracy of cancer risk prediction was greatly affected by regional differences, cancer types and model types. We divided the model variables into four categories: environment, behavioral lifestyle, biological genetics and clinical examination, and found that there are differences in the distribution of various variables among different cancer types. Taking 50 genes involved in the lung cancer risk prediction models as an example to perform pathway enrichment analyses and the results showed that these genes were significantly enriched in p53 Signaling and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling pathways which are associated with cancer and specific diseases. In addition, we verified the biological significance of overlapping lung cancer genes via STRING database. CRPMKB was established to provide researchers an online tool for the future personalized model application and developing. This study of CRPMKB suggests that developing more targeted models based on specific demographic characteristics and cancer types will further improve the accuracy of cancer risk model predictions.

The current release contains information on 25,101 DEGs representing 14,320 unique rat genes that change transcription levels in 21 tissues of 10 genetic rat strains used as models of 11 human diseases based on 45 original scientific papers. RatDEGdb is novel in that, unlike any other biomedical database, it offers the manually curated annotations of DEGs in model rats with the use of independent clinical data on equal changes in the expression of homologous genes revealed in people with pathologies. The rat DEGs put in RatDEGdb were annotated with equal changes in the expression of their human homologs in affected people. In its current release, RatDEGdb contains 94,873 such annotations for 321 human genes in 836 diseases based on 959 original scientific papers found in the current PubMed. RatDEGdb may be interesting first of all to human geneticists, molecular biologists, clinical physicians, genetic advisors as well as experts in biopharmaceutics, bioinformatics and personalized genomics.

Herein, an Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine version 2.0 (ETCM v2.0, http://www.tcmip.cn/ETCM2/front/#/) was constructed as the latest curated database hosting 48,442 TCM formulas recorded by ancient Chinese medical books, 9872 Chinese patent drugs, 2079 Chinese medicinal materials and 38,298 ingredients. To facilitate the mechanistic research and new drug discovery, we improved the target identification method based on a two-dimensional ligand similarity search module, which provides the confirmed and/or potential targets of each ingredient, as well as their binding activities. Importantly, five TCM formulas/Chinese patent drugs/herbs/ingredients with the highest Jaccard similarity scores to the submitted drugs are offered in ETCM v2.0, which may be of significance to identify prescriptions/herbs/ingredients with similar clinical efficacy, to summarize the rules of prescription use, and to find alternative drugs for endangered Chinese medicinal materials. Moreover, ETCM v2.0 provides an enhanced JavaScript-based network visualization tool for creating, modifying and exploring multi-scale biological networks.

"36029479","SLOAD: a comprehensive database of cancer-specific synthetic lethal interactions for precision cancer therapy via multi-omics analysis. Synthetic lethality has been widely concerned because of its potential role in cancer treatment, which can be harnessed to selectively kill cancer cells via identifying inactive genes in a specific cancer type and further targeting the corresponding synthetic lethal partners. Herein, to obtain cancer-specific synthetic lethal interactions, we aimed to predict genetic interactions via a pan-cancer analysis from multiple molecular levels using random forest and then develop a user-friendly database. First, based on collected public gene pairs with synthetic lethal interactions, candidate gene pairs were analyzed via integrating multi-omics data, mainly including DNA mutation, copy number variation, methylation and mRNA expression data. Then, integrated features were used to predict cancer-specific synthetic lethal interactions using random forest. Finally, SLOAD (http://www.tmliang.cn/SLOAD) was constructed via integrating these findings, which was a user-friendly database for data searching, browsing, downloading and analyzing. These results can provide candidate cancer-specific synthetic lethal interactions, which will contribute to drug designing in cancer treatment that can promote therapy strategies based on the principle of synthetic lethality.

"36408909","tModBase: deciphering the landscape of tRNA modifications and their dynamic changes from epitranscriptome data. tRNA molecules contain dense, abundant modifications that affect tRNA structure, stability, mRNA decoding and tsRNA formation. tRNA modifications and related enzymes are responsive to environmental cues and are associated with a range of physiological and pathological processes. However, there is a lack of resources that can be used to mine and analyse these dynamically changing tRNA modifications. In this study, we established tModBase (https://www.tmodbase.com/) for deciphering the landscape of tRNA modification profiles from epitranscriptome data. We analysed 103 datasets generated with second- and third-generation sequencing technologies and illustrated the misincorporation and termination signals of tRNA modification sites in ten species. We thus systematically demonstrate the modification profiles across different tissues/cell lines and summarize the characteristics of tRNA-associated human diseases. By integrating transcriptome data from 32 cancers, we developed novel tools for analysing the relationships between tRNA modifications and RNA modification enzymes, the expression of 1442 tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), and 654 DNA variations.

"34718712","PCMDB: a curated and comprehensive resource of plant cell markers. The advent of single-cell sequencing opened a new era in transcriptomic and genomic research. To understand cell composition using single-cell studies, a variety of cell markers have been widely used to label individual cell types. However, the specific database of cell markers for use by the plant research community remains very limited. To overcome this problem, we developed the Plant Cell Marker DataBase (PCMDB, http://www.tobaccodb.org/pcmdb/), which is based on a uniform annotation pipeline.

Tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns can be visualized using multiple tools: eFP Browser, Bar, and UMAP/TSNE graph. The PCMDB also supports several analysis tools, including SCSA and SingleR, which allows for user annotation of cell types. To provide information about plant species currently unsupported in PCMDB, potential marker genes for other plant species can be searched based on homology with the supported species. PCMDB is a user-friendly hierarchical platform that contains five built-in search engines. We believe PCMDB will constitute a useful resource for researchers working on cell type annotation and the prediction of the biological function of individual cells.","1/1/2022","http://www.tobaccodb.org/pcmdb","PCMDB",0.998084247112274,"Plant Cell Marker DataBase",0.953205893437068,"PCMDB",0.998084247,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

The exome data were retrieved from NCBI SRA and an NGS data clean-up protocol was implemented to obtain the best quality reads. The reads which passed the quality checks were then used for calling the variants which were then processed and filtered. This data was used to normalize and the normalized data generated was used for developing the database.

"34669946","webTWAS: a resource for disease candidate susceptibility genes identified by transcriptome-wide association study. The development of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) has enabled researchers to better identify and interpret causal genes in many diseases. However, there are currently no resources providing a comprehensive listing of gene-disease associations discovered by TWAS from published GWAS summary statistics. TWAS analyses are also difficult to conduct due to the complexity of TWAS software pipelines. To address these issues, we introduce a new resource called webTWAS, which integrates a database of the most comprehensive disease GWAS datasets currently available with credible sets of potential causal genes identified by multiple TWAS software packages. Specifically, a total of 235 064 gene-diseases associations for a wide range of human diseases are prioritized from 1298 high-quality downloadable European GWAS summary statistics. Associations are calculated with seven different statistical models based on three popular and representative TWAS software packages. Users can explore associations at the gene or disease level, and easily search for related studies or diseases using the MeSH disease tree. Since the effects of diseases are highly tissue-specific, webTWAS applies tissue-specific enrichment analysis to identify significant tissues.

"37730114","HPC-Atlas: Computationally Constructing A Comprehensive Atlas of Human Protein Complexes. A fundamental principle of biology is that proteins tend to form complexes to play important roles in the core functions of cells. For a complete understanding of human cellular functions, it is crucial to have a comprehensive atlas of human protein complexes. Unfortunately, we still lack such a comprehensive atlas of experimentally validated protein complexes, which prevents us from gaining a complete understanding of the compositions and functions of human protein complexes, as well as the underlying biological mechanisms. To fill this gap, we built Human Protein Complexes Atlas (HPC-Atlas), as far as we know, the most accurate and comprehensive atlas of human protein complexes available to date. We integrated two latest protein interaction networks, and developed a novel computational method to identify nearly 9000 protein complexes, including many previously uncharacterized complexes. Compared with the existing methods, our method achieved outstanding performance on both testing and independent datasets. Furthermore, with HPC-Atlas we identified 751 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-affected human protein complexes, and 456 multifunctional proteins that contain many potential moonlighting proteins. These results suggest that HPC-Atlas can serve as not only a computing framework to effectively identify biologically meaningful protein complexes by integrating multiple protein data sources, but also a valuable resource for exploring new biological findings.

"36896476","IGTCM: An integrative genome database of traditional Chinese medicine plants. Fully understanding traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) is still challenging because of the extreme complexity of their chemical components and mechanisms of action. The TCM Plant Genome Project aimed to obtain genetic information, determine gene functions, discover regulatory networks of herbal species, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease prevention and treatment, thereby accelerating the modernization of TCMs. A comprehensive database that contains TCM-related information will provide a vital resource. Here, we present an integrative genome database of TCM plants (IGTCM) that contains 14,711,220 records of 83 annotated TCM-related herb genomes, including 3,610,350 genes, 3,534,314 proteins and corresponding coding sequences, and 4,032,242 RNAs, as well as 1033 non-redundant component records for 68 herbs, downloaded and integrated from the GenBank and RefSeq databases. For minimal interconnectivity, each gene, protein, and component was annotated using the eggNOG-mapper tool and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database to acquire pathway information and enzyme classifications. These features can be linked across several species and different components. The IGTCM database also provides visualization and sequence similarity search tools for data analyses. These annotated herb genome sequences in IGTCM database are a necessary resource for systematically exploring genes related to the biosynthesis of compounds that have significant medicinal activities and excellent agronomic traits that can be used to improve TCM-related varieties through molecular breeding. It also provides valuable data and tools for future research on drug discovery and the protection and rational use of TCM plant resources.

"35758881","RegEl corpus: identifying DNA regulatory elements in the scientific literature. High-throughput technologies led to the generation of a wealth of data on regulatory DNA elements in the human genome. However, results from disease-driven studies are primarily shared in textual form as scientific articles. Information extraction (IE) algorithms allow this information to be (semi-)automatically accessed. Their development, however, is dependent on the availability of annotated corpora. Therefore, we introduce RegEl (Regulatory Elements), the first freely available corpus annotated with regulatory DNA elements comprising 305 PubMed abstracts for a total of 2690 sentences. We focus on enhancers, promoters and transcription factor binding sites. Three annotators worked in two stages, achieving an overall 0.73 F1 inter-annotator agreement and 0.46 for regulatory elements. Depending on the entity type, IE baselines reach F1-scores of 0.48-0.91 for entity detection and 0.71-0.88 for entity normalization. Next, we apply our entity detection models to the entire PubMed collection and extract co-occurrences of genes or diseases with regulatory elements.

"36526439","CafeteriaSA corpus: scientific abstracts annotated across different food semantic resources. In the last decades, a great amount of work has been done in predictive modeling of issues related to human and environmental health. Resolution of issues related to healthcare is made possible by the existence of several biomedical vocabularies and standards, which play a crucial role in understanding the health information, together with a large amount of health-related data. However, despite a large number of available resources and work done in the health and environmental domains, there is a lack of semantic resources that can be utilized in the food and nutrition domain, as well as their interconnections. For this purpose, in a European Food Safety Authority-funded project CAFETERIA, we have developed the first annotated corpus of 500 scientific abstracts that consists of 6407 annotated food entities with regard to Hansard taxonomy, 4299 for FoodOn and 3623 for SNOMED-CT.

"37124321","MYRiAD: a multi-array room acoustic database. In the development of acoustic signal processing algorithms, their evaluation in various acoustic environments is of utmost importance. In order to advance evaluation in realistic and reproducible scenarios, several high-quality acoustic databases have been developed over the years. In this paper, we present another complementary database of acoustic recordings, referred to as the Multi-arraY Room Acoustic Database (MYRiAD). The MYRiAD database is unique in its diversity of microphone configurations suiting a wide range of enhancement and reproduction applications (such as assistive hearing, teleconferencing, or sound zoning), the acoustics of the two recording spaces, and the variety of contained signals including 1214 room impulse responses (RIRs), reproduced speech, music, and stationary noise, as well as recordings of live cocktail parties held in both rooms. The microphone configurations comprise a dummy head (DH) with in-ear omnidirectional microphones, two behind-the-ear (BTE) pieces equipped with 2 omnidirectional microphones each, 5 external omnidirectional microphones (XMs), and two concentric circular microphone arrays (CMAs) consisting of 12 omnidirectional microphones in total. The two recording spaces, namely the SONORA Audio Laboratory (SAL) and the Alamire Interactive Laboratory (AIL), have reverberation times of 2.1 s and 0.5 s, respectively. Audio signals were reproduced using 10 movable loudspeakers in the SAL and a built-in array of 24 loudspeakers in the AIL.

"37026389","Cyanoseq: A database of cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences with curated taxonomy. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that occupy various habitats across the globe, playing critical roles in many of Earth's biogeochemical cycles both in both aquatic and terrestrial systems. Despite their well-known significance, their taxonomy remains problematic and is the subject of much research. Taxonomic issues of Cyanobacteria have consequently led to inaccurate curation within known reference databases, ultimately leading to problematic taxonomic assignment during diversity studies. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have increased our ability to characterize and understand microbial communities, leading to the generation of thousands of sequences that require taxonomic assignment. We herein propose CyanoSeq (https://zenodo.org/record/7569105), a database of cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences with curated taxonomy. The taxonomy of CyanoSeq is based on the current state of cyanobacterial taxonomy, with ranks from the domain to genus level. Files are provided for use with common naive Bayes taxonomic classifiers, such as those included in DADA2 or the QIIME2 platform. Additionally, FASTA files are provided for creation of de novo phylogenetic trees with (near) full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences to determine the phylogenetic relationship of cyanobacterial strains and/or ASV/OTUs. The database currently consists of 5410 cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences along with 123 Chloroplast, Bacterial, and Vampirovibrionia (formally Melainabacteria) sequences.","5/22/2023","http://zenodo.org/record/7569105","CyanoSeq",0.997192025184631,"",0,"CyanoSeq",0.997192025,1,"","","","","","","",NA,""

"37106367","PlaASDB: a comprehensive database of plant alternative splicing events in response to stress. Background Alternative splicing (AS) is a co-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of plants in response to environmental stress. However, the role of AS in biotic and abiotic stress responses remains largely unknown. To speed up our understanding of plant AS patterns under different stress responses, development of informative and comprehensive plant AS databases is highly demanded. Description In this study, we first collected 3,255 RNA-seq data under biotic and abiotic stresses from two important model plants (Arabidopsis and rice). Then, we conducted AS event detection and gene expression analysis, and established a user-friendly plant AS database termed PlaASDB. By using representative samples from this highly integrated database resource, we compared AS patterns between Arabidopsis and rice under abiotic and biotic stresses, and further investigated the corresponding difference between AS and gene expression. Specifically, we found that differentially spliced genes (DSGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEG) share very limited overlapping under all kinds of stresses, suggesting that gene expression regulation and AS seemed to play independent roles in response to stresses. Compared with gene expression, Arabidopsis and rice were more inclined to have conserved AS patterns under stress conditions. Conclusion PlaASDB is a comprehensive plant-specific AS database that mainly integrates the AS and gene expression data of Arabidopsis and rice in stress response. Through large-scale comparative analyses, the global landscape of AS events in Arabidopsis and rice was observed. We believe that PlaASDB could help researchers understand the regulatory mechanisms of AS in plants under stresses more conveniently.

To meet this requirement, we have developed a comprehensive and easy-to-use database called PlaPPISite ( http://zzdlab.com/plappisite/index.php ) to present interaction details for 13 plant interactomes. Here, we provide a clear guide on how to search and view protein interaction details through the PlaPPISite database. Firstly, the running environment of our database is introduced. Secondly, the input file format is briefly introduced. Moreover, we discussed which information related to interaction sites can be achieved through several examples. In addition, some notes about PlaPPISite are also provided. More importantly, we would like to emphasize the importance of interaction site information in plant systems biology through this user guide of PlaPPISite. In particular, the easily accessible 3D structures of PPIs in the coming post-AlphaFold2 era will definitely boost the application of plant interactome to decipher the molecular mechanisms of many fundamental biological issues.","1/1/2023","http://zzdlab.com/plappisite/index.php","PlaPPISite",0.995016873,"",0,"PlaPPISite",0.9950168729,1,"32028878","","","","merge on record with best name prob","","",NA,""
